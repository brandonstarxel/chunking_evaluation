operating activities higher net income in 2014 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2013, despite higher income tax payments. 2014 income tax payments were higher than 2013 primarily due to higher income, but also because we paid taxes previously deferred by bonus depreciation (discussed below). higher net income in 2013 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2012. in addition, we made payments in 2012 for past wages as a result of national labor negotiations, which reduced cash provided by operating activities in 2012. lower tax benefits from bonus depreciation (as discussed below) partially offset the increases. federal tax law provided for 100% (100%) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50% (50%) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012-2013. as a result, the company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011-2013 income tax expense, contributing to the positive operating cash flow in those years. congress extended 50% (50%) bonus depreciation for 2014, but this extension occurred in december and did not have a significant benefit on our income tax payments during 2014. investing activities higher capital investments, including the early buyout of the long-term operating lease of our headquarters building for approximately $261 million, drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2013. significant investments also were made for new locomotives, freight cars and containers, and capacity and commercial facility projects. capital investments in 2014 also included $99 million for the early buyout of locomotives and freight cars under long-term operating leases, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions. lower capital investments in locomotives and freight cars in 2013 drove the decrease in cash used in investing activities compared to 2012. included in capital investments in 2012 was $75 million for the early buyout of 165 locomotives under long-term operating and capital leases during the first quarter of 2012, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions..

what was the cash provided by operating activities in 2013? 6823.0

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by $374 million to $3547 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. the increase primarily was attributable to an improvement in our operating working capital balances of $570 million as discussed below, and $187 million related to lower net income tax payments, as compared to 2009. partially offsetting these improvements was a net reduction in cash from operations of $350 million related to our defined benefit pension plan. this reduction was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of $758 million as compared to 2009, partially offset by an increase in the cas costs recovered on our contracts. operating working capital accounts consists of receivables, inventories, accounts payable, and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred. the improvement in cash provided by operating working capital was due to a decline in 2010 accounts receivable balances compared to 2009, and an increase in 2010 customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred balances compared to 2009. these improvements partially were offset by a decline in accounts payable balances in 2010 compared to 2009. the decline in accounts receivable primarily was due to higher collections on various programs at electronic systems, is&gs, and space systems business areas. the increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred primarily was attributable to an increase on government and commercial satellite programs at space systems and air mobility programs at aeronautics, partially offset by a decrease on various programs at electronic systems. the decrease in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of accounts payable activities across all segments. net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1248 million to $3173 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. the decline primarily was attributable to an increase in our contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of $1373 million as compared to 2008 and an increase in our operating working capital accounts of $147 million. partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower net income tax payments in 2009 as compared to 2008 in the amount of $319 million. the decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the ms2 and gt&l lines of business at electronic systems and an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at aeronautics, which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on government satellite programs at space systems and the timing of accounts payable activities. investing activities capital expenditures 2013 the majority of our capital expenditures relate to facilities infrastructure and equipment that are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. we also incur capital expenditures for it to support programs and general enterprise it infrastructure. capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment amounted to $820 million in 2010, $852 million in 2009, and $926 million in 2008. we expect that our operating cash flows will continue to be sufficient to fund our annual capital expenditures over the next few years. acquisitions, divestitures and other activities 2013 acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates. amounts paid in 2010 of $148 million primarily related to investments in affiliates. we paid $435 million in 2009 for acquisition activities, compared with $233 million in 2008. in 2010, we received proceeds of $798 million from the sale of eig, net of $17 million in transaction costs (see note 2). there were no material divestiture activities in 2009 and 2008. during 2010, we increased our short-term investments by $171 million compared to an increase of $279 million in 2009. financing activities share activity and dividends 2013 during 2010, 2009, and 2008, we repurchased 33.0 million, 24.9 million, and 29.0 million shares of our common stock for $2483 million, $1851 million, and $2931 million. of the shares we repurchased in 2010, 0.9 million shares for $63 million were repurchased in december but settled and were paid for in january 2011. in october 2010, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of our common stock from time-to-time, up to an authorized amount of $3.0 billion (see note 12). under the program, we have discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation. we repurchased a total of 11.2 million shares under the program for $776 million, and as of december 31, 2010, there remained $2224 million available for additional share repurchases. in connection with their approval of the new share repurchase program, our board

operating profit margin in 2018 was negatively affected by an increase in commodity costs, the recognition of the inventory step up adjustment established as a part of the the acquisition of kichler and an increase in other expenses (such as logistics costs, salaries and erp costs). these negative impacts were partially offset by increased net selling prices, benefits associated with cost savings initiatives and increased sales volume. operating profit margin in 2017 was positively impacted by increased sales volume, cost savings initiatives, and a more favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs. operating profit margin in 2017 was negatively impacted by an increase in strategic growth investments and certain other expenses, including stock-based compensation, health insurance costs, trade show costs and increased head count. due to the recently-announced increase in tariffs on imported materials from china, and assuming tariffs rise to 25 percent in 2019, we could be exposed to approximately $150 million of potential annual direct cost increases. we will work to mitigate the impact of these tariffs through a combination of price increases, supplier negotiations, supply chain repositioning and other internal productivity measures. other income (expense), net other, net, for 2018 included $14 million of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost and $8 million of realized foreign currency losses. these expenses were partially offset by $3 million of earnings related to equity method investments and $1 million related to distributions from private equity funds. other, net, for 2017 included $26 million related to periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs, $13 million net loss related to the divestitures of moores and arrow and $2 million related to the impairment of a private equity fund, partially offset by $3 million related to distributions from private equity funds and $1 million of earnings related to equity method investments..

the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 1046 gwh, or 8% (8%), in billed electricity usage in all sectors, primarily due to the effect of more favorable weather on the residential sector. gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges (credits) gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $22 million in power management rider revenue as the result of higher rates, the volume/weather variance discussed above, and an increase in grand gulf rider revenue as a result of higher rates and increased usage, offset by a decrease of $23.5 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates. fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in deferred fuel expense as a result of prior over-collections, offset by an increase in the average market price of purchased power coupled with increased net area demand. other regulatory charges increased primarily due to increased recovery of costs associated with the power management recovery rider. other income statement variances 2011 compared to 2010 other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to: a $5.4 million decrease in compensation and benefits costs primarily resulting from an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation in 2010 and a decrease in stock option expense; and the sale of $4.9 million of surplus oil inventory. the decrease was partially offset by an increase of $3.9 million in legal expenses due to the deferral in 2010 of certain litigation expenses in accordance with regulatory treatment. taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes due to a higher 2011 assessment as compared to 2010, partially offset by higher capitalized property taxes as compared with prior year. depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. interest expense decreased primarily due to a revision caused by ferc 2019s acceptance of a change in the treatment of funds received from independent power producers for transmission interconnection projects..

entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management 2019s financial discussion and analysis results of operations net income 2016 compared to 2015 net income increased $37.9 million primarily due to lower other operation and maintenance expenses, the asset write-off of its receivable associated with the spindletop gas storage facility in 2015, and higher net revenue. 2015 compared to 2014 net income decreased $5.2 million primarily due to the asset write-off of its receivable associated with the spindletop gas storage facility and higher other operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher net revenue and a lower effective tax rate. net revenue 2016 compared to 2015 net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2016 to 2015. amount (in millions).

operating activities higher net income in 2014 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2013, despite higher income tax payments. 2014 income tax payments were higher than 2013 primarily due to higher income, but also because we paid taxes previously deferred by bonus depreciation (discussed below). higher net income in 2013 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2012. in addition, we made payments in 2012 for past wages as a result of national labor negotiations, which reduced cash provided by operating activities in 2012. lower tax benefits from bonus depreciation (as discussed below) partially offset the increases. federal tax law provided for 100% (100%) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50% (50%) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012-2013. as a result, the company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011-2013 income tax expense, contributing to the positive operating cash flow in those years. congress extended 50% (50%) bonus depreciation for 2014, but this extension occurred in december and did not have a significant benefit on our income tax payments during 2014. investing activities higher capital investments, including the early buyout of the long-term operating lease of our headquarters building for approximately $261 million, drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2013. significant investments also were made for new locomotives, freight cars and containers, and capacity and commercial facility projects. capital investments in 2014 also included $99 million for the early buyout of locomotives and freight cars under long-term operating leases, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions. lower capital investments in locomotives and freight cars in 2013 drove the decrease in cash used in investing activities compared to 2012. included in capital investments in 2012 was $75 million for the early buyout of 165 locomotives under long-term operating and capital leases during the first quarter of 2012, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions..

in 2007, we expect our total capital investments to be approximately $3.2 billion, which may include long- term leases. these investments will be used to maintain track and structures, continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors, remove bottlenecks, upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs, build and improve facilities and terminals, and develop and implement new technologies. we designed these investments to maintain infrastructure for safety, enhance customer service, promote growth, and improve operational fluidity. we expect to fund our 2007 cash capital investments through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, and cash on hand at december 31, 2006. we expect that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet our expected capital requirements for 2007. for the years ended december 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 4.4, 2.9, and 2.1, respectively. the increases in 2006 and 2005 were driven by higher net income. the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis. earnings represent income from continuing operations, less equity earnings net of distributions, plus fixed charges and income taxes. fixed charges represent interest charges, amortization of debt discount, and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges. see exhibit 12 for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges. financing activities credit facilities 2013 on december 31, 2006, we had $2 billion in revolving credit facilities available, including $1 billion under a five-year facility expiring in march 2009 and $1 billion under a five-year facility expiring in march 2010 (collectively, the "facilities"). the facilities are designated for general corporate purposes and support the issuance of commercial paper. neither of the facilities were drawn on in 2006. commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment-grade borrowers. these facilities allow for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates, plus a spread, depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings. the facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth and a debt to net worth coverage ratio. at december 31, 2006, we were in compliance with these covenants. the facilities do not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require the posting of collateral. in addition to our revolving credit facilities, we had $150 million in uncommitted lines of credit available, including $75 million that expires in march 2007 and $75 million expiring in may 2007. neither of these lines of credit were used as of december 31, 2006. we must have equivalent credit available under our five-year facilities to draw on these $75 million lines. dividends 2013 on january 30, 2007, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share, payable beginning on april 2, 2007, to shareholders of record on february 28, 2007. we expect to fund the increase in the quarterly dividend through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, and cash on hand at december 31, 2006. dividend restrictions 2013 we are subject to certain restrictions related to the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders due to minimum net worth requirements under our credit facilities. retained earnings available.

2007 compared with 2006 total net revenue of $71.4 billion was up $9.4 billion, or 15% (15%), from the prior year. higher net interest income, very strong private equity gains, record asset management, administration and commissions revenue, higher mortgage fees and related income and record investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth. these increases were offset partially by lower trading revenue. investment banking fees grew in 2007 to a level higher than the pre- vious record set in 2006. record advisory and equity underwriting fees drove the results, partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees. for a further discussion of investment banking fees, which are primarily recorded in ib, see the ib segment results on pages 40 201342 of this annual report. principal transactions revenue consists of trading revenue and private equity gains. trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006 level, primarily due to markdowns in ib of $1.4 billion (net of hedges) on subprime positions, including subprime cdos, and $1.3 billion (net of fees) on leveraged lending funded loans and unfunded commitments. also in ib, markdowns in securitized products on nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading performance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong revenue in both rates and equities. equities benefited from strong client activity and record trading results across all products. ib 2019s credit portfolio results increased compared with the prior year, primarily driven by higher revenue from risk management activities. the increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains, the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments resulting from the adoption of sfas 157 (201cfair value measurements 201d). for a further discussion of principal transactions revenue, see the ib and corporate segment results on pages 40 201342 and 59 201360, respectively, and note 6 on page 122 of this annual report. lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level, driven pri- marily by higher deposit-related fees and the bank of new york transaction. for a further discussion of lending & deposit-related fees, which are mostly recorded in rfs, tss and cb, see the rfs segment results on pages 43 201348, the tss segment results on pages 54 201355, and the cb segment results on pages 52 201353 of this annual report. asset management, administration and commissions revenue reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006. increased assets under management and higher performance and placement fees in am drove the record results. the 18% (18%) growth in assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset inflows and market appreciation across all segments: institutional, retail, private bank and private client services. tss also contributed to the rise in asset management, administration and commissions revenue, driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody. finally, commissions revenue increased, due mainly to higher brokerage transaction volume (primarily included within fixed income and equity markets revenue of ib), which more than offset the sale of the insurance business by rfs in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuities. for additional information on these fees and commissions, see the segment discussions for ib on pages 40 201342, rfs on pages 43 201348, tss on pages 54 201355, and am on pages 56 201358, of this annual report. the favorable variance resulting from securities gains in 2007 compared with securities losses in 2006 was primarily driven by improvements in the results of repositioning of the treasury invest- ment securities portfolio. also contributing to the positive variance was a $234 million gain from the sale of mastercard shares. for a fur- ther discussion of securities gains (losses), which are mostly recorded in the firm 2019s treasury business, see the corporate segment discussion on pages 59 201360 of this annual report. consol idated results of operat ions.

the above net unrealized loss amounts at december 31, 2009 and december 31, 2008 excluded the remaining net unrealized loss of $1.01 billion, or $635 million after-tax, and $2.27 billion, or $1.39 billion after- tax, respectively, related to reclassifications of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity. these after-tax amounts are recorded in other comprehensive income. the decline in the remaining after-tax unrealized loss amounts related to transferred securities resulted from amortization and from the recognition of losses from other-than-temporary impairment on certain of the securities. we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether other-than-temporary impairment exists. to the extent that other-than-temporary impairment is identified, the impairment is broken into a credit component and a non-credit component. the credit component is recognized in our consolidated statement of income, and the non-credit component is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that management does not intend to sell the security (see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8). the assessment of other-than-temporary impairment involves an evaluation of economic and security- specific factors, which are more fully described in note 3. such factors are based upon estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance. to the extent that market conditions are worse than management 2019s expectations, other-than-temporary impairment could increase, in particular the credit component that would be recognized in our consolidated statement of income. national housing prices, according to the case-shiller national hpi, have declined to date approximately 30% (30%) peak-to-current. management currently estimates that national housing prices will continue to decline and bottom out during the second half of 2010, consistent with a peak-to-trough housing price decline of approximately 37% (37%). as an indication of the sensitivity of our portfolio with respect to our more significant assumptions underlying our assessment of impairment, if we were to increase our default estimates to 110% (110%) of management 2019s current expectations with a corresponding slowing of prepayment speeds to 90% (90%) of management 2019s current expectations, credit-related other-than-temporary impairment could increase by approximately $120 million to $125 million, which impairment would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income. excluding the securities for which other-than-temporary impairment was recorded, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining securities and the resulting net unrealized losses to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. additional information about our assessment of impairment is provided in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8..

the analysis of our depreciation studies. changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively. under group depreciation, the historical cost (net of salvage) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using (i) inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and (ii) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies. the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes. because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired, we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate. in addition, we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies. any deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets. for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions: (i) is unusual, (ii) is material in amount, and (iii) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies. a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations. when we purchase an asset, we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use. however, many of our assets are self-constructed. a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties, which is typically performed by our employees, and for track line expansion and other capacity projects. costs that are directly attributable to capital projects (including overhead costs) are capitalized. direct costs that are capitalized as part of self- constructed assets include material, labor, and work equipment. indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset. general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred. normal repairs and maintenance are also expensed as incurred, while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset, improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized. these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases. total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $2.4 billion for 2014, $2.3 billion for 2013, and $2.1 billion for 2012. assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease. 13. accounts payable and other current liabilities dec. 31, dec. 31, millions 2014 2013.

2014 compared to 2013 mst 2019s net sales decreased $305 million, or 3% (3%), in 2014 as compared to 2013. net sales decreased by approximately $305 million due to the wind-down or completion of certain c4isr programs (primarily ptds); about $85 million for undersea systems programs due to decreased volume and deliveries; and about $55 million related to the settlements of contract cost matters on certain programs in 2013 that were not repeated in 2014 (including a portion of the terminated presidential helicopter program). the decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $80 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors programs due to increased volume (primarily space fence); and approximately $40 million for training and logistics solutions programs due to increased deliveries (primarily close combat tactical trainer). mst 2019s operating profit decreased $129 million, or 12% (12%), in 2014 as compared to 2013. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $120 million related to the settlements of contract cost matters on certain programs in 2013 that were not repeated in 2014 (including a portion of the terminated presidential helicopter program); approximately $55 million due to the reasons described above for lower c4isr program sales, as well as performance matters on an international program; and approximately $45 million due to higher reserves recorded on certain training and logistics solutions programs. the decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $45 million for performance matters and reserves recorded in 2013 that were not repeated in 2014; and about $60 million for various programs due to increased risk retirements (including mh-60 and radar surveillance programs). adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $85 million lower for 2014 compared to 2013. backlog backlog increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the addition of sikorsky backlog, as well as higher orders on new program starts (such as australian defence force pilot training system). backlog increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher orders on new program starts (such as space fence). trends we expect mst 2019s 2016 net sales to increase in the mid-double digit percentage range compared to 2015 net sales due to the inclusion of sikorsky programs for a full year, partially offset by a decline in volume due to the wind-down or completion of certain programs. operating profit is expected to be equivalent to 2015 on higher volume, and operating margin is expected to decline due to costs associated with the sikorsky acquisition, including the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, integration costs and inherited restructuring costs associated with actions committed to by sikorsky prior to acquisition. space systems our space systems business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems. space systems provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. space systems is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. space systems 2019 major programs include the trident ii d5 fleet ballistic missile (fbm), orion, space based infrared system (sbirs), aehf, gps-iii, geostationary operational environmental satellite r-series (goes-r), and muos. operating profit for our space systems business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in ula, which provides expendable launch services to the u.s. government. space systems 2019 operating results included the following (in millions):.

2015 compared to 2014 space systems 2019 net sales in 2015 decreased $97 million, or 1% (1%), compared to 2014. the decrease was attributable to approximately $335 million lower net sales for government satellite programs due to decreased volume (primarily aehf) and the wind-down or completion of mission solutions programs; and approximately $55 million for strategic missile and defense systems due to lower volume. these decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $235 million for businesses acquired in 2014; and approximately $75 million for the orion program due to increased volume..

62 general mills amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss unrealized losses from interest rate cash flow hedges recorded in aoci as of may 27, 2012, totaled $73.6 million after tax. these deferred losses are primarily related to interest rate swaps that we entered into in contemplation of future borrowings and other financ- ing requirements and that are being reclassified into net interest over the lives of the hedged forecasted transac- tions. unrealized losses from foreign currency cash flow hedges recorded in aoci as of may 27, 2012, were $1.7 million after-tax. the net amount of pre-tax gains and losses in aoci as of may 27, 2012, that we expect to be reclassified into net earnings within the next 12 months is $14.0 million of expense. credit-risk-related contingent features certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from each of the major credit rat- ing agencies. if our debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization on derivative instru- ments in net liability positions. the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on may 27, 2012, was $19.9 million. we have posted col- lateral of $4.3 million in the normal course of business associated with these contracts. if the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on may 27, 2012, we would have been required to post an additional $15.6 million of collateral to counterparties. concentrations of credit and counterparty credit risk during fiscal 2012, wal-mart stores, inc. and its affili- ates (wal-mart) accounted for 22 percent of our con- solidated net sales and 30 percent of our net sales in the u.s. retail segment. no other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. wal- mart also represented 6 percent of our net sales in the international segment and 7 percent of our net sales in the bakeries and foodservice segment. as of may 27, 2012, wal-mart accounted for 26 percent of our u.s. retail receivables, 5 percent of our international receiv- ables, and 9 percent of our bakeries and foodservice receivables. the five largest customers in our u.s. retail segment accounted for 54 percent of its fiscal 2012 net sales, the five largest customers in our international segment accounted for 26 percent of its fiscal 2012 net sales, and the five largest customers in our bakeries and foodservice segment accounted for 46 percent of its fis- cal 2012 net sales. we enter into interest rate, foreign exchange, and cer- tain commodity and equity derivatives, primarily with a diversified group of highly rated counterparties. we continually monitor our positions and the credit rat- ings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one party. these transactions may expose us to potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these counterparties; however, we have not incurred a material loss. we also enter into commodity futures transactions through vari- ous regulated exchanges. the amount of loss due to the credit risk of the coun- terparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the contracts, is $19.5 million against which we do not hold collateral. under the terms of master swap agreements, some of our transactions require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to threshold levels of exposure and counterparty credit risk. collateral assets are either cash or u.s. treasury instruments and are held in a trust account that we may access if the counterparty defaults. note 8. debt notes payable the components of notes payable and their respective weighted-average interest rates at the end of the periods were as follows:.

impairment the following table presents net unrealized losses on securities available for sale as of december 31:.

amortized cost | 100013 | 82329
net unrealized loss pre-tax | $-181 (181) | $-448 (448)
net unrealized loss after-tax | $-113 (113) | $-270 (270)

the net unrealized amounts presented above excluded the remaining net unrealized losses related to reclassifications of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity. these unrealized losses related to reclassifications totaled $303 million, or $189 million after-tax, and $523 million, or $317 million after-tax, as of december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, or oci. refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8. the decline in these remaining after-tax unrealized losses related to reclassifications from december 31, 2010 to december 31, 2011 resulted primarily from amortization. we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether other-than-temporary impairment exists. to the extent that other-than-temporary impairment is identified, the impairment is broken into a credit component and a non-credit component. the credit component is recorded in our consolidated statement of income, and the non-credit component is recorded in oci to the extent that we do not intend to sell the security. our assessment of other-than-temporary impairment involves an evaluation, more fully described in note 3, of economic and security-specific factors. such factors are based on estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance. to the extent that market conditions are worse than management 2019s expectations, other-than-temporary impairment could increase, in particular, the credit component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income. given the exposure of our investment securities portfolio, particularly mortgage- and asset-backed securities, to residential mortgage and other consumer credit risks, the performance of the u.s. housing market is a significant driver of the portfolio 2019s credit performance. as such, our assessment of other-than-temporary impairment relies to a significant extent on our estimates of trends in national housing prices. generally, indices that measure trends in national housing prices are published in arrears. as of september 30, 2011, national housing prices, according to the case-shiller national home price index, had declined by approximately 31.3% (31.3%) peak-to-current. overall, management 2019s expectation, for purposes of its evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment as of december 31, 2011, was that housing prices would decline by approximately 35% (35%) peak-to-trough. the performance of certain mortgage products and vintages of securities continues to deteriorate. in addition, management continues to believe that housing prices will decline further as indicated above. the combination of these factors has led to an increase in management 2019s overall loss expectations. our investment portfolio continues to be sensitive to management 2019s estimates of future cumulative losses. ultimately, other-than- temporary impairment is based on specific cusip-level detailed analysis of the unique characteristics of each security. in addition, we perform sensitivity analysis across each significant product type within the non-agency u.s. residential mortgage-backed portfolio. we estimate, for example, that other-than-temporary impairment of the investment portfolio could increase by approximately $10 million to $50 million, if national housing prices were to decline by 37% (37%) to 39% (39%) peak-to-trough, compared to management 2019s expectation of 35% (35%) described above. this sensitivity estimate is based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of housing prices and the timing of defaults. to the extent that such factors differ substantially from management 2019s current expectations, resulting loss estimates may differ materially from those stated. excluding the securities for which other-than-temporary impairment was recorded in 2011, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining.

the analysis of our depreciation studies. changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively. under group depreciation, the historical cost (net of salvage) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using (i) inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and (ii) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies. the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes. because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired, we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate. in addition, we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies. any deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets. for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions: (i) is unusual, (ii) is material in amount, and (iii) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies. a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations. when we purchase an asset, we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use. however, many of our assets are self-constructed. a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties, which is typically performed by our employees, and for track line expansion and other capacity projects. costs that are directly attributable to capital projects (including overhead costs) are capitalized. direct costs that are capitalized as part of self- constructed assets include material, labor, and work equipment. indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset. general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred. normal repairs and maintenance are also expensed as incurred, while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset, improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized. these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases. total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $2.4 billion for 2014, $2.3 billion for 2013, and $2.1 billion for 2012. assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease. 13. accounts payable and other current liabilities dec. 31, dec. 31, millions 2014 2013.

item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (amounts in millions) in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. from time to time, we use derivative instruments, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations. the majority of our debt (approximately 89% (89%) and 91% (91%) as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively) bears interest at fixed rates. we do have debt with variable interest rates, but a 10% (10%) increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows. the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates, and the impact of a 10% (10%) change in interest rates is summarized below. increase/ (decrease) in fair market value as of december 31, 10% (10%) increase in interest rates 10% (10%) decrease in interest rates.

we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31, 2015. we had $1509.7 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31, 2015 that we generally invest in conservative, short-term bank deposits or securities. the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. during 2015 and 2014, we had interest income of $22.8 and $27.4, respectively. based on our 2015 results, a 100-basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $15.0, assuming that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2015 levels. foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2015 included the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling and euro. based on 2015 exchange rates and operating results, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10% (10%), we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4% (4%), assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2015 levels. the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, in the stockholders 2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. however, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures. we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes..

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently under examination by the relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded. while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe we have appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits. however, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty. it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material, but cannot be estimated as of december 31, 2016. our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted. 22. discontinued operations brazil distribution 2014 due to a portfolio evaluation in the first half of 2016, management has decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distribution companies in brazil, aes sul and eletropaulo. the disposal of sul was completed in october 2016. in december 2016, eletropaulo underwent a corporate restructuring which is expected to, among other things, provide more liquidity of its shares. aes is continuing to pursue strategic options for eletropaulo in order to complete its strategic shift to reduce aes 2019 exposure to the brazilian distribution business, including preparation for listing its shares into the novo mercado, which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance. the company executed an agreement for the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary aes sul in june 2016. we have reported the results of operations and financial position of aes sul as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria, the company recognized an after tax loss of $382 million comprised of a pretax impairment charge of $783 million, offset by a tax benefit of $266 million related to the impairment of the sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $135 million for deferred taxes related to the investment in aes sul. prior to the impairment charge in the second quarter, the carrying value of the aes sul asset group of $1.6 billion was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell. however, the impairment charge was limited to the carrying value of the long lived assets of the aes sul disposal group. on october 31, 2016, the company completed the sale of aes sul and received final proceeds less costs to sell of $484 million, excluding contingent consideration. upon disposal of aes sul, we incurred an additional after- tax loss on sale of $737 million. the cumulative impact to earnings of the impairment and loss on sale was $1.1 billion. this includes the reclassification of approximately $1 billion of cumulative translation losses, resulting in a net reduction to the company 2019s stockholders 2019 equity of $92 million. sul 2019s pretax loss attributable to aes for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1.4 billion and $32 million, respectively. sul 2019s pretax gain attributable to aes for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $133 million. prior to its classification as discontinued operations, sul was reported in the brazil sbu reportable segment. as discussed in note 1 2014general and summary of significant accounting policies, effective july 1, 2014, the company prospectively adopted asu no. 2014-08. discontinued operations prior to adoption of asu no. 2014-08 include the results of cameroon, saurashtra and various u.s. wind projects which were each sold in the first half of cameroon 2014 in september 2013, the company executed agreements for the sale of its 56% (56%) equity interests in businesses in cameroon: sonel, an integrated utility, kribi, a gas and light fuel oil plant, and dibamba, a heavy.

material impact on the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for a 1% (1%) change in the assumed health care trend rate. for most of the participants in the u.s. plan, aon 2019s liability for future plan cost increases for pre-65 and medical supplement plan coverage is limited to 5% (5%) per annum. because of this cap, net employer trend rates for these plans are effectively limited to 5% (5%) per year in the future. during 2007, aon recognized a plan amendment which phases out post-65 retiree coverage in its u.s. plan over the next three years. the impact of this amendment on net periodic benefit cost is being recognized over the average remaining service life of the employees. 14. stock compensation plans the following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense recognized in continuing operations in the consolidated statements of income in compensation and benefits (in millions):.

during 2009, the company converted its stock administration system to a new service provider. in connection with this conversion, a reconciliation of the methodologies and estimates utilized was performed, which resulted in a $12 million reduction of expense for the year ended december 31, 2009. stock awards stock awards, in the form of rsus, are granted to certain employees and consist of both performance-based and service-based rsus. service-based awards generally vest between three and ten years from the date of grant. the fair value of service-based awards is based upon the market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant. with certain limited exceptions, any break in continuous employment will cause the forfeiture of all unvested awards. compensation expense associated with stock awards is recognized over the service period. dividend equivalents are paid on certain service-based rsus, based on the initial grant amount. performance-based rsus have been granted to certain employees. vesting of these awards is contingent upon meeting various individual, divisional or company-wide performance conditions, including revenue generation or growth in revenue, pretax income or earnings per share over a one- to five-year period. the performance conditions are not considered in the determination of the grant date fair value for these awards. the fair value of performance-based awards is based upon the market price of the underlying common stock at the date of grant. compensation expense is recognized over the performance period, and in certain cases an additional vesting period, based on management 2019s estimate of the number of units expected to vest. compensation expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares paid out at the end of the programs. the actual payout of shares under these performance- based plans may range from 0-200% (0-200%) of the number of units granted, based on the plan. dividend equivalents are generally not paid on the performance-based rsus. during 2010, the company granted approximately 1.6 million shares in connection with the completion of the 2007 leadership performance plan (2018 2018lpp 2019 2019) cycle and 84000 shares related to other performance plans. during 2010, 2009 and 2008, the company granted approximately 3.5 million.

pension expense.

- | 2016 | 2015 | 2014
pension expense | $68.1 | $135.6 | $135.9
special terminations settlements and curtailments (included above) | 7.3 | 35.2 | 5.8
weighted average discount rate (a) | 4.1% (4.1%) | 4.0% (4.0%) | 4.6% (4.6%)
weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets | 7.5% (7.5%) | 7.4% (7.4%) | 7.7% (7.7%)
weighted average expected rate of compensation increase | 3.5% (3.5%) | 3.5% (3.5%) | 3.9% (3.9%)

(a) effective in 2016, the company began to measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as we believe this provides a better measurement of these costs. the company has accounted for this as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly has accounted for it on a prospective basis. this change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation. 2016 vs. 2015 pension expense, excluding special items, decreased from the prior year due to the adoption of the spot rate approach which reduced service cost and interest cost, the impact from expected return on assets and demographic gains, partially offset by the impact of the adoption of new mortality tables for our major plans. special items of $7.3 included pension settlement losses of $6.4, special termination benefits of $2.0, and curtailment gains of $1.1. these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions. 2015 vs. 2014 the decrease in pension expense, excluding special items, was due to the impact from expected return on assets, a 40 bp reduction in the weighted average compensation increase assumption, and lower service cost and interest cost. the decrease was partially offset by the impact of higher amortization of actuarial losses, which resulted primarily from a 60 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate. special items of $35.2 included pension settlement losses of $21.2, special termination benefits of $8.7, and curtailment losses of $5.3. these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions. 2017 outlook in 2017, pension expense, excluding special items, is estimated to be approximately $70 to $75, an increase of $10 to $15 from 2016, resulting primarily from a decrease in discount rates, offset by favorable asset experience, effects of the versum spin-off and the adoption of new mortality tables. pension settlement losses of $10 to $15 are expected, dependent on the timing of retirements. in 2017, we expect pension expense to include approximately $164 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $121 in 2016. net actuarial losses of $484 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2016, primarily attributable to lower discount rates and improved mortality projections. actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2017. during the first quarter of 2017, the company expects to record a curtailment loss estimated to be $5 to $10 related to employees transferring to versum. the loss will be reflected in the results from discontinued operations on the consolidated income statements. we continue to evaluate opportunities to manage the liabilities associated with our pension plans. pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. with respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. in addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. with the assistance of third party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. during 2016 and 2015, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $79.3 and $137.5, respectively. for 2017, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $65 to $85. the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which.

in the year of 2016, what percentage did the pension settlement losses represent in relation to the total of special terminations settlements and curtailments? 0.87671

and from 2015 to that year, what was the change in the cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans? -58.2

how much did this change represent in relation to those contributions in 2015?

included in the corporate and consumer loan tables above are purchased distressed loans, which are loans that have evidenced significant credit deterioration subsequent to origination but prior to acquisition by citigroup. in accordance with sop 03-3, the difference between the total expected cash flows for these loans and the initial recorded investments is recognized in income over the life of the loans using a level yield. accordingly, these loans have been excluded from the impaired loan information presented above. in addition, per sop 03-3, subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows for a purchased distressed loan require a build of an allowance so the loan retains its level yield. however, increases in the expected cash flows are first recognized as a reduction of any previously established allowance and then recognized as income prospectively over the remaining life of the loan by increasing the loan 2019s level yield. where the expected cash flows cannot be reliably estimated, the purchased distressed loan is accounted for under the cost recovery method. the carrying amount of the company 2019s purchased distressed loan portfolio at december 31, 2010 was $392 million, net of an allowance of $77 million as of december 31, 2010. the changes in the accretable yield, related allowance and carrying amount net of accretable yield for 2010 are as follows: in millions of dollars accretable carrying amount of loan receivable allowance.

generally, our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period, followed by a 20 year amortization term. during the draw period, we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay interest only and home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay principal and interest. based upon outstanding balances at december 31, 2011, the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end. home equity lines of credit - draw period end dates in millions interest only product principal and interest product.

the above net unrealized loss amounts at december 31, 2009 and december 31, 2008 excluded the remaining net unrealized loss of $1.01 billion, or $635 million after-tax, and $2.27 billion, or $1.39 billion after- tax, respectively, related to reclassifications of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity. these after-tax amounts are recorded in other comprehensive income. the decline in the remaining after-tax unrealized loss amounts related to transferred securities resulted from amortization and from the recognition of losses from other-than-temporary impairment on certain of the securities. we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether other-than-temporary impairment exists. to the extent that other-than-temporary impairment is identified, the impairment is broken into a credit component and a non-credit component. the credit component is recognized in our consolidated statement of income, and the non-credit component is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that management does not intend to sell the security (see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8). the assessment of other-than-temporary impairment involves an evaluation of economic and security- specific factors, which are more fully described in note 3. such factors are based upon estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance. to the extent that market conditions are worse than management 2019s expectations, other-than-temporary impairment could increase, in particular the credit component that would be recognized in our consolidated statement of income. national housing prices, according to the case-shiller national hpi, have declined to date approximately 30% (30%) peak-to-current. management currently estimates that national housing prices will continue to decline and bottom out during the second half of 2010, consistent with a peak-to-trough housing price decline of approximately 37% (37%). as an indication of the sensitivity of our portfolio with respect to our more significant assumptions underlying our assessment of impairment, if we were to increase our default estimates to 110% (110%) of management 2019s current expectations with a corresponding slowing of prepayment speeds to 90% (90%) of management 2019s current expectations, credit-related other-than-temporary impairment could increase by approximately $120 million to $125 million, which impairment would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income. excluding the securities for which other-than-temporary impairment was recorded, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining securities and the resulting net unrealized losses to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. additional information about our assessment of impairment is provided in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8..

sfas no. 109, 201caccounting for income taxes, 201d requires that companies record a valuation allowance when it is 201cmore likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 201d at december 31, 2005, the company has provided a valuation allowance of approximately $422.4 million, including approximately $249.5 million attributable to spectrasite, primarily related to net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. approximately $237.8 million of the spectrasite valuation allowance was assumed as of the acquisition date. the balance of the valuation allowance primarily relates to net state deferred tax assets. the company has not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily its federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes the company will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty-year tax carryforward period. the company intends to recover a portion of its deferred tax asset through its federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. in june 2003 and october 2003, the company filed federal income tax refund claims with the irs relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003, of which the company initially anticipated receiving approximately $90.0 million. based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities, the company has revised its estimate of the net realizable value of the federal income tax refund claims and anticipates receiving a refund of approximately $65.0 million as a result of these claims by the end of 2006. there can be no assurances, however, with respect to the specific amount and timing of any refund. the recoverability of the company 2019s remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on its current operations. the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of its assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. accordingly, the recoverability of the net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. based on its current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that the net deferred tax asset will be realized. the realization of the company 2019s deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2005 will be dependent upon its ability to generate approximately $1.3 billion in taxable income from january 1, 2006 to december 31, 2025. if the company is unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, or carry back losses, as described above, it will be required to reduce its net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders 2019 equity. from time to time the company is subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which the company has significant business operations. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. during the year ended.

2011 compared to 2010 mst 2019s net sales for 2011 decreased $311 million, or 4% (4%), compared to 2010. the decrease was attributable to decreased volume of approximately $390 million for certain ship and aviation system programs (primarily maritime patrol aircraft and ptds) and approximately $75 million for training and logistics solutions programs. partially offsetting these decreases was higher sales of about $165 million from production on the lcs program. mst 2019s operating profit for 2011 decreased $68 million, or 10% (10%), compared to 2010. the decrease was attributable to decreased operating profit of approximately $55 million as a result of increased reserves for contract cost matters on various ship and aviation system programs (including the terminated presidential helicopter program) and approximately $40 million due to lower volume and increased reserves on training and logistics solutions. partially offsetting these decreases was higher operating profit of approximately $30 million in 2011 primarily due to the recognition of reserves on certain undersea systems programs in 2010. adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments described above, were approximately $55 million lower in 2011 compared to 2010. backlog backlog increased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to increased orders on ship and aviation system programs (primarily mh-60 and lcs), partially offset decreased orders and higher sales volume on integrated warfare systems and sensors programs (primarily aegis). backlog decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher sales volume on various integrated warfare systems and sensors programs. trends we expect mst 2019s net sales to decline in 2013 in the low single digit percentage range as compared to 2012 due to the completion of ptds deliveries in 2012 and expected lower volume on training services programs. operating profit and margin are expected to increase slightly from 2012 levels primarily due to anticipated improved contract performance. space systems our space systems business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering, and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems, and space transportation systems. space systems is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. space systems 2019 major programs include the space-based infrared system (sbirs), advanced extremely high frequency (aehf) system, mobile user objective system (muos), global positioning satellite (gps) iii system, geostationary operational environmental satellite r-series (goes-r), trident ii d5 fleet ballistic missile, and orion. operating results for our space systems business segment include our equity interests in united launch alliance (ula), which provides expendable launch services for the u.s. government, united space alliance (usa), which provided processing activities for the space shuttle program and is winding down following the completion of the last space shuttle mission in 2011, and a joint venture that manages the u.k. 2019s atomic weapons establishment program. space systems 2019 operating results included the following (in millions):.

at december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had a modest working capital surplus. this reflects a strong cash position that provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment. in addition, we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements, and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities. cash flows.

operating activities cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower net income and changes in working capital, partially offset by the timing of tax payments. federal tax law provided for 100% (100%) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50% (50%) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012-2013. as a result, the company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011-2013 income tax expense, contributing to the positive operating cash flow in those years. congress extended 50% (50%) bonus depreciation for 2014, but this extension occurred in december, and the related benefit was realized in 2015, rather than 2014. similarly, in december of 2015, congress extended bonus depreciation through 2019, which delayed the benefit of 2015 bonus depreciation into 2016. bonus depreciation will be at a rate of 50% (50%) for 2015, 2016 and 2017, 40% (40%) for 2018 and 30% (30%) for 2019. higher net income in 2014 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2013, despite higher income tax payments. 2014 income tax payments were higher than 2013 primarily due to higher income, but also because we paid taxes previously deferred by bonus depreciation. investing activities higher capital investments in locomotives and freight cars, including $327 million in early lease buyouts, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions, drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014. higher capital investments, including the early buyout of the long-term operating lease of our headquarters building for approximately $261 million, drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013. significant investments also were made for new locomotives, freight cars and containers, and capacity and commercial facility projects. capital investments in 2014 also included $99 million for the early buyout of locomotives and freight cars under long-term operating leases, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions..

2011 compared to 2010 mst 2019s net sales for 2011 decreased $311 million, or 4% (4%), compared to 2010. the decrease was attributable to decreased volume of approximately $390 million for certain ship and aviation system programs (primarily maritime patrol aircraft and ptds) and approximately $75 million for training and logistics solutions programs. partially offsetting these decreases was higher sales of about $165 million from production on the lcs program. mst 2019s operating profit for 2011 decreased $68 million, or 10% (10%), compared to 2010. the decrease was attributable to decreased operating profit of approximately $55 million as a result of increased reserves for contract cost matters on various ship and aviation system programs (including the terminated presidential helicopter program) and approximately $40 million due to lower volume and increased reserves on training and logistics solutions. partially offsetting these decreases was higher operating profit of approximately $30 million in 2011 primarily due to the recognition of reserves on certain undersea systems programs in 2010. adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments described above, were approximately $55 million lower in 2011 compared to 2010. backlog backlog increased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to increased orders on ship and aviation system programs (primarily mh-60 and lcs), partially offset decreased orders and higher sales volume on integrated warfare systems and sensors programs (primarily aegis). backlog decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher sales volume on various integrated warfare systems and sensors programs. trends we expect mst 2019s net sales to decline in 2013 in the low single digit percentage range as compared to 2012 due to the completion of ptds deliveries in 2012 and expected lower volume on training services programs. operating profit and margin are expected to increase slightly from 2012 levels primarily due to anticipated improved contract performance. space systems our space systems business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering, and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems, and space transportation systems. space systems is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. space systems 2019 major programs include the space-based infrared system (sbirs), advanced extremely high frequency (aehf) system, mobile user objective system (muos), global positioning satellite (gps) iii system, geostationary operational environmental satellite r-series (goes-r), trident ii d5 fleet ballistic missile, and orion. operating results for our space systems business segment include our equity interests in united launch alliance (ula), which provides expendable launch services for the u.s. government, united space alliance (usa), which provided processing activities for the space shuttle program and is winding down following the completion of the last space shuttle mission in 2011, and a joint venture that manages the u.k. 2019s atomic weapons establishment program. space systems 2019 operating results included the following (in millions):.

2012 compared to 2011 space systems 2019 net sales for 2012 increased $186 million, or 2% (2%), compared to 2011. the increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $150 million due to increased commercial satellite deliveries (two commercial satellites delivered in 2012 compared to one during 2011); about $125 million from the orion program due to higher volume and an increase in risk retirements; and approximately $70 million from increased volume on various strategic and defensive missile programs. partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately $105 million from certain government satellite programs (primarily sbirs and muos) as a result of decreased volume and a decline in risk retirements; and about $55 million from the nasa external tank program, which ended in connection with the completion of the space shuttle program in 2011..

the aes corporation notes to consolidated financial statements 2014 (continued) december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was dispatched starting in february 2018. aes puerto rico continues to be the lowest cost and epa compliant energy provider in puerto rico. therefore, we expect aes puerto rico to continue to be a critical supplier to prepa. starting prior to the hurricanes, prepa has been facing economic challenges that could impact the company, and on july 2, 2017, filed for bankruptcy under title iii. as a result of the bankruptcy filing, aes puerto rico and aes ilumina 2019s non-recourse debt of $365 million and $36 million, respectively, is in default and has been classified as current as of december 31, 2017. in november 2017, aes puerto rico signed a forbearance and standstill agreement with its lenders to prevent the lenders from taking any action against the company due to the default events. this agreement will expire on march 22, 2018. the company's receivable balances in puerto rico as of december 31, 2017 totaled $86 million, of which $53 million was overdue. after the filing of title iii protection, and up until the disruption caused by the hurricanes, aes in puerto rico was collecting the overdue amounts from prepa in line with historic payment patterns. considering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carrying amount of our assets in puerto rico of $627 million is recoverable as of december 31, 2017 and no reserve on the receivables is required. foreign currency risks 2014 aes operates businesses in many foreign countries and such operations could be impacted by significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. fluctuations in currency exchange rate between u.s. dollar and the following currencies could create significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows: the argentine peso, the brazilian real, the dominican republic peso, the euro, the chilean peso, the colombian peso, and the philippine peso. concentrations 2014 due to the geographical diversity of its operations, the company does not have any significant concentration of customers or sources of fuel supply. several of the company's generation businesses rely on ppas with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant businesses' output over the term of the ppas. however, no single customer accounted for 10% (10%) or more of total revenue in 2017, 2016 or 2015. the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses depend on the credit quality of our customers and the continued ability of our customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under ppas and fuel supply agreements. if a substantial portion of the company's long-term ppas and/or fuel supply were modified or terminated, the company would be adversely affected to the extent that it would be unable to replace such contracts at equally favorable terms. 26. related party transactions certain of our businesses in panama and the dominican republic are partially owned by governments either directly or through state-owned institutions. in the ordinary course of business, these businesses enter into energy purchase and sale transactions, and transmission agreements with other state-owned institutions which are controlled by such governments. at two of our generation businesses in mexico, the offtakers exercise significant influence, but not control, through representation on these businesses' boards of directors. these offtakers are also required to hold a nominal ownership interest in such businesses. in chile, we provide capacity and energy under contractual arrangements to our investment which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. additionally, the company provides certain support and management services to several of its affiliates under various agreements. the company's consolidated statements of operations included the following transactions with related parties for the periods indicated (in millions):.

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently under examination by the relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded. while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe we have appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits. however, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty. it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material, but cannot be estimated as of december 31, 2016. our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted. 22. discontinued operations brazil distribution 2014 due to a portfolio evaluation in the first half of 2016, management has decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distribution companies in brazil, aes sul and eletropaulo. the disposal of sul was completed in october 2016. in december 2016, eletropaulo underwent a corporate restructuring which is expected to, among other things, provide more liquidity of its shares. aes is continuing to pursue strategic options for eletropaulo in order to complete its strategic shift to reduce aes 2019 exposure to the brazilian distribution business, including preparation for listing its shares into the novo mercado, which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance. the company executed an agreement for the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary aes sul in june 2016. we have reported the results of operations and financial position of aes sul as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria, the company recognized an after tax loss of $382 million comprised of a pretax impairment charge of $783 million, offset by a tax benefit of $266 million related to the impairment of the sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $135 million for deferred taxes related to the investment in aes sul. prior to the impairment charge in the second quarter, the carrying value of the aes sul asset group of $1.6 billion was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell. however, the impairment charge was limited to the carrying value of the long lived assets of the aes sul disposal group. on october 31, 2016, the company completed the sale of aes sul and received final proceeds less costs to sell of $484 million, excluding contingent consideration. upon disposal of aes sul, we incurred an additional after- tax loss on sale of $737 million. the cumulative impact to earnings of the impairment and loss on sale was $1.1 billion. this includes the reclassification of approximately $1 billion of cumulative translation losses, resulting in a net reduction to the company 2019s stockholders 2019 equity of $92 million. sul 2019s pretax loss attributable to aes for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1.4 billion and $32 million, respectively. sul 2019s pretax gain attributable to aes for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $133 million. prior to its classification as discontinued operations, sul was reported in the brazil sbu reportable segment. as discussed in note 1 2014general and summary of significant accounting policies, effective july 1, 2014, the company prospectively adopted asu no. 2014-08. discontinued operations prior to adoption of asu no. 2014-08 include the results of cameroon, saurashtra and various u.s. wind projects which were each sold in the first half of cameroon 2014 in september 2013, the company executed agreements for the sale of its 56% (56%) equity interests in businesses in cameroon: sonel, an integrated utility, kribi, a gas and light fuel oil plant, and dibamba, a heavy.

entergy texas, inc. management's financial discussion and analysis fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in power purchases as a result of the purchased power agreements between entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy texas and an increase in the average market prices of purchased power and natural gas, substantially offset by a decrease in deferred fuel expense as a result of decreased recovery from customers of fuel costs. other regulatory charges increased primarily due to an increase of $6.9 million in the recovery of bond expenses related to the securitization bonds. the recovery became effective july 2007. see note 5 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization bonds. 2007 compared to 2006 net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2007 to 2006. amount (in millions).

volume/weather | 9.7
transmission revenue | 6.1
base revenue | 2.6
other | -2.4 (2.4)

operating activities higher net income in 2014 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2013, despite higher income tax payments. 2014 income tax payments were higher than 2013 primarily due to higher income, but also because we paid taxes previously deferred by bonus depreciation (discussed below). higher net income in 2013 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2012. in addition, we made payments in 2012 for past wages as a result of national labor negotiations, which reduced cash provided by operating activities in 2012. lower tax benefits from bonus depreciation (as discussed below) partially offset the increases. federal tax law provided for 100% (100%) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50% (50%) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012-2013. as a result, the company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011-2013 income tax expense, contributing to the positive operating cash flow in those years. congress extended 50% (50%) bonus depreciation for 2014, but this extension occurred in december and did not have a significant benefit on our income tax payments during 2014. investing activities higher capital investments, including the early buyout of the long-term operating lease of our headquarters building for approximately $261 million, drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2013. significant investments also were made for new locomotives, freight cars and containers, and capacity and commercial facility projects. capital investments in 2014 also included $99 million for the early buyout of locomotives and freight cars under long-term operating leases, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions. lower capital investments in locomotives and freight cars in 2013 drove the decrease in cash used in investing activities compared to 2012. included in capital investments in 2012 was $75 million for the early buyout of 165 locomotives under long-term operating and capital leases during the first quarter of 2012, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions..

what was the cash provided by operating activities in 2013? 6823.0

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by $374 million to $3547 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. the increase primarily was attributable to an improvement in our operating working capital balances of $570 million as discussed below, and $187 million related to lower net income tax payments, as compared to 2009. partially offsetting these improvements was a net reduction in cash from operations of $350 million related to our defined benefit pension plan. this reduction was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of $758 million as compared to 2009, partially offset by an increase in the cas costs recovered on our contracts. operating working capital accounts consists of receivables, inventories, accounts payable, and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred. the improvement in cash provided by operating working capital was due to a decline in 2010 accounts receivable balances compared to 2009, and an increase in 2010 customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred balances compared to 2009. these improvements partially were offset by a decline in accounts payable balances in 2010 compared to 2009. the decline in accounts receivable primarily was due to higher collections on various programs at electronic systems, is&gs, and space systems business areas. the increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred primarily was attributable to an increase on government and commercial satellite programs at space systems and air mobility programs at aeronautics, partially offset by a decrease on various programs at electronic systems. the decrease in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of accounts payable activities across all segments. net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1248 million to $3173 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. the decline primarily was attributable to an increase in our contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of $1373 million as compared to 2008 and an increase in our operating working capital accounts of $147 million. partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower net income tax payments in 2009 as compared to 2008 in the amount of $319 million. the decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the ms2 and gt&l lines of business at electronic systems and an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at aeronautics, which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on government satellite programs at space systems and the timing of accounts payable activities. investing activities capital expenditures 2013 the majority of our capital expenditures relate to facilities infrastructure and equipment that are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. we also incur capital expenditures for it to support programs and general enterprise it infrastructure. capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment amounted to $820 million in 2010, $852 million in 2009, and $926 million in 2008. we expect that our operating cash flows will continue to be sufficient to fund our annual capital expenditures over the next few years. acquisitions, divestitures and other activities 2013 acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates. amounts paid in 2010 of $148 million primarily related to investments in affiliates. we paid $435 million in 2009 for acquisition activities, compared with $233 million in 2008. in 2010, we received proceeds of $798 million from the sale of eig, net of $17 million in transaction costs (see note 2). there were no material divestiture activities in 2009 and 2008. during 2010, we increased our short-term investments by $171 million compared to an increase of $279 million in 2009. financing activities share activity and dividends 2013 during 2010, 2009, and 2008, we repurchased 33.0 million, 24.9 million, and 29.0 million shares of our common stock for $2483 million, $1851 million, and $2931 million. of the shares we repurchased in 2010, 0.9 million shares for $63 million were repurchased in december but settled and were paid for in january 2011. in october 2010, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of our common stock from time-to-time, up to an authorized amount of $3.0 billion (see note 12). under the program, we have discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation. we repurchased a total of 11.2 million shares under the program for $776 million, and as of december 31, 2010, there remained $2224 million available for additional share repurchases. in connection with their approval of the new share repurchase program, our board terminated our previous share repurchase program. cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with stock option exercises during 2010, 2009, and 2008 totaled $59 million, $40 million, and $250 million. those activities resulted in the issuance of 1.4 million shares, 1.0 million shares, and 4.7 million shares during the respective periods..

2007 compared with 2006 total net revenue of $71.4 billion was up $9.4 billion, or 15% (15%), from the prior year. higher net interest income, very strong private equity gains, record asset management, administration and commissions revenue, higher mortgage fees and related income and record investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth. these increases were offset partially by lower trading revenue. investment banking fees grew in 2007 to a level higher than the pre- vious record set in 2006. record advisory and equity underwriting fees drove the results, partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees. for a further discussion of investment banking fees, which are primarily recorded in ib, see the ib segment results on pages 40 201342 of this annual report. principal transactions revenue consists of trading revenue and private equity gains. trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006 level, primarily due to markdowns in ib of $1.4 billion (net of hedges) on subprime positions, including subprime cdos, and $1.3 billion (net of fees) on leveraged lending funded loans and unfunded commitments. also in ib, markdowns in securitized products on nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading performance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong revenue in both rates and equities. equities benefited from strong client activity and record trading results across all products. ib 2019s credit portfolio results increased compared with the prior year, primarily driven by higher revenue from risk management activities. the increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains, the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments resulting from the adoption of sfas 157 (201cfair value measurements 201d). for a further discussion of principal transactions revenue, see the ib and corporate segment results on pages 40 201342 and 59 201360, respectively, and note 6 on page 122 of this annual report. lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level, driven pri- marily by higher deposit-related fees and the bank of new york transaction. for a further discussion of lending & deposit-related fees, which are mostly recorded in rfs, tss and cb, see the rfs segment results on pages 43 201348, the tss segment results on pages 54 201355, and the cb segment results on pages 52 201353 of this annual report. asset management, administration and commissions revenue reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006. increased assets under management and higher performance and placement fees in am drove the record results. the 18% (18%) growth in assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset inflows and market appreciation across all segments: institutional, retail, private bank and private client services. tss also contributed to the rise in asset management, administration and commissions revenue, driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody. finally, commissions revenue increased, due mainly to higher brokerage transaction volume (primarily included within fixed income and equity markets revenue of ib), which more than offset the sale of the insurance business by rfs in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuities. for additional information on these fees and commissions, see the segment discussions for ib on pages 40 201342, rfs on pages 43 201348, tss on pages 54 201355, and am on pages 56 201358, of this annual report. the favorable variance resulting from securities gains in 2007 compared with securities losses in 2006 was primarily driven by improvements in the results of repositioning of the treasury invest- ment securities portfolio. also contributing to the positive variance was a $234 million gain from the sale of mastercard shares. for a fur- ther discussion of securities gains (losses), which are mostly recorded in the firm 2019s treasury business, see the corporate segment discussion on pages 59 201360 of this annual report. consol idated results of operat ions.

amortized over a nine-year period beginning december 2015. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the business combination and customer credits. the volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of more favorable weather during the unbilled period and an increase in industrial usage, partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales. the increase in industrial usage is primarily due to expansion projects, primarily in the chemicals industry, and increased demand from new customers, primarily in the industrial gases industry. the louisiana act 55 financing savings obligation variance results from a regulatory charge for tax savings to be shared with customers per an agreement approved by the lpsc. the tax savings resulted from the 2010-2011 irs audit settlement on the treatment of the louisiana act 55 financing of storm costs for hurricane gustav and hurricane ike. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the settlement and benefit sharing. included in other is a provision of $23 million recorded in 2016 related to the settlement of the waterford 3 replacement steam generator prudence review proceeding, offset by a provision of $32 million recorded in 2015 related to the uncertainty at that time associated with the resolution of the waterford 3 replacement steam generator prudence review proceeding. a0 see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the waterford 3 replacement steam generator prudence review proceeding. entergy wholesale commodities following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2016 to 2015. amount (in millions).

divestiture of our arrow and moores businesses, and an unfavorable sales mix of international plumbing products, which, in aggregate, decreased sales by two percent. net sales for 2016 were positively affected by increased sales volume of plumbing products, paints and other coating products and builders' hardware. net sales for 2016 were also positively affected by favorable sales mix of cabinets and windows, and net selling price increases of north american windows and north american and international plumbing products. net sales for 2016 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of cabinets and lower net selling prices of paints and other coating products. our gross profit margins were 32.2 percent, 34.2 percent and 33.4 percent in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the 2018 gross profit margin was negatively impacted by an increase in commodity costs, the recognition of the inventory step up adjustment established as a part of the the acquisition of kichler, an increase in other expenses (such as logistics costs and salaries) and unfavorable sales mix. these negative impacts were partially offset by an increase in net selling prices, the benefits associated with cost savings initiatives, and increased sales volume. the 2017 gross profit margin was positively impacted by increased sales volume, a more favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs, and cost savings initiatives. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 17.7 percent in 2018 compared with 18.6 percent in 2017 and 18.7 percent in 2016. the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, was driven by leverage of fixed expenses, due primarily to increased sales volume, and improved cost control. the following table reconciles reported operating profit to operating profit, as adjusted to exclude certain items, dollars in millions:.

operating profit margins as adjusted | 15.1% (15.1%) | 15.7% (15.7%) | 15.1% (15.1%)

operating profit margin in 2018 was negatively affected by an increase in commodity costs, the recognition of the inventory step up adjustment established as a part of the the acquisition of kichler and an increase in other expenses (such as logistics costs, salaries and erp costs). these negative impacts were partially offset by increased net selling prices, benefits associated with cost savings initiatives and increased sales volume. operating profit margin in 2017 was positively impacted by increased sales volume, cost savings initiatives, and a more favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs. operating profit margin in 2017 was negatively impacted by an increase in strategic growth investments and certain other expenses, including stock-based compensation, health insurance costs, trade show costs and increased head count. due to the recently-announced increase in tariffs on imported materials from china, and assuming tariffs rise to 25 percent in 2019, we could be exposed to approximately $150 million of potential annual direct cost increases. we will work to mitigate the impact of these tariffs through a combination of price increases, supplier negotiations, supply chain repositioning and other internal productivity measures. other income (expense), net other, net, for 2018 included $14 million of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost and $8 million of realized foreign currency losses. these expenses were partially offset by $3 million of earnings related to equity method investments and $1 million related to distributions from private equity funds. other, net, for 2017 included $26 million related to periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs, $13 million net loss related to the divestitures of moores and arrow and $2 million related to the impairment of a private equity fund, partially offset by $3 million related to distributions from private equity funds and $1 million of earnings related to equity method investments..

transaction and commercial issues in many of our businesses. these skills are a valuable resource as we monitor regulatory and tariff schemes to determine our capital budgeting needs and integrate acquisitions. the company expects to realize cost reduction and performance improvement benefits in both earnings and cash flows; however, there can be no assurance that the reductions and improvements will continue and our inability to sustain the reductions and improvements may result in less than expected earnings and cash flows in 2004 and beyond. asset sales during 2003, we continued the initiative to sell all or part of certain of the company 2019s subsidiaries. this initiative was designed to decrease the company 2019s dependence on access to capital markets and improve the strength of our balance sheet by reducing financial leverage and improving liquidity. the following chart details the asset sales that were closed during 2003. sales proceeds project name date completed (in millions) location.

the company continues to evaluate its portfolio and business performance and may decide to dispose of additional businesses in the future. however given the improvements in our liquidity there will be a lower emphasis placed on asset sales in the future for purposes of improving liquidity and strengthening the balance sheet. for any sales that happen in the future, there can be no guarantee that the proceeds from such sale transactions will cover the entire investment in the subsidiaries. depending on which businesses are eventually sold, the entire or partial sale of any business may change the current financial characteristics of the company 2019s portfolio and results of operations. furthermore future sales may impact the amount of recurring earnings and cash flows the company would expect to achieve. subsidiary restructuring during 2003, we completed and initiated restructuring transactions for several of our south american businesses. the efforts are focused on improving the businesses long-term prospects for generating acceptable returns on invested capital or extending short-term debt maturities. businesses impacted include eletropaulo, tiete, uruguaiana and sul in brazil and gener in chile. brazil eletropaulo. aes has owned an interest in eletropaulo since april 1998, when the company was privatized. in february 2002 aes acquired a controlling interest in the business and as a consequence started to consolidate it. aes financed a significant portion of the acquisition of eletropaulo, including both common and preferred shares, through loans and deferred purchase price financing arrangements provided by the brazilian national development bank 2014 (2018 2018bndes 2019 2019), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, bndes participac 0327o 0303es s.a.

annual report 2013 duke realty corporation 37 in addition to the capitalization of overhead costs discussed above, we also capitalized $16.8 million, $9.4 million and $4.3 million of interest costs in the years ended december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. the following table summarizes our second generation capital expenditures by reportable operating segment (in thousands):.

- | 2013 | 2012 | 2011
industrial | $41971 | $33095 | $34872
office | 46600 | 30092 | 63933

non-reportable rental operations segments | 121 | 56 | 49
total | $91798 | $63884 | $99264

both our first and second generation expenditures vary significantly between leases on a per square foot basis, dependent upon several factors including the product type, the nature of a tenant's operations, the specific physical characteristics of each individual property as well as the market in which the property is located. second generation expenditures related to the 79 suburban office buildings that were sold in the blackstone office disposition totaled $26.2 million in 2011. dividends and distributions we are required to meet the distribution requirements of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), in order to maintain our reit status. we paid dividends of $0.68 per common share for each of the years ended december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. we expect to continue to distribute at least an amount equal to our taxable earnings, to meet the requirements to maintain our reit status, and additional amounts as determined by our board of directors. distributions are declared at the discretion of our board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. at december 31, 2013 we had three series of preferred stock outstanding. the annual dividend rates on our preferred shares range between 6.5% (6.5%) and 6.625% (6.625%) and are paid quarterly in arrears. in february 2013, we redeemed all of our outstanding series o shares for a total payment of $178.0 million, thus reducing our future quarterly dividend commitments by $3.7 million. in march 2012, we redeemed all of our 6.950% (6.950%) series m cumulative redeemable preferred shares ("series m shares") for a total payment of $168.3 million, thus reducing our future quarterly dividend commitments by $2.9 million. in july 2011, we redeemed all of our 7.25% (7.25%) series n cumulative redeemable preferred shares ("series n shares") for a total payment of $108.6 million, thus reducing our future quarterly dividend commitments by $2.0 million. debt maturities debt outstanding at december 31, 2013 had a face value totaling $4.3 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.49% (5.49%) and with maturity dates ranging between 2014 and 2028. of this total amount, we had $3.1 billion of unsecured debt, $1.1 billion of secured debt and $88.0 million outstanding on the drlp unsecured line of credit at december 31, 2013. we made scheduled and unscheduled principal payments of $1.0 billion on outstanding debt during the year ended december 31, 2013..

operating activities higher net income in 2014 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2013, despite higher income tax payments. 2014 income tax payments were higher than 2013 primarily due to higher income, but also because we paid taxes previously deferred by bonus depreciation (discussed below). higher net income in 2013 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2012. in addition, we made payments in 2012 for past wages as a result of national labor negotiations, which reduced cash provided by operating activities in 2012. lower tax benefits from bonus depreciation (as discussed below) partially offset the increases. federal tax law provided for 100% (100%) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50% (50%) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012-2013. as a result, the company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011-2013 income tax expense, contributing to the positive operating cash flow in those years. congress extended 50% (50%) bonus depreciation for 2014, but this extension occurred in december and did not have a significant benefit on our income tax payments during 2014. investing activities higher capital investments, including the early buyout of the long-term operating lease of our headquarters building for approximately $261 million, drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2013. significant investments also were made for new locomotives, freight cars and containers, and capacity and commercial facility projects. capital investments in 2014 also included $99 million for the early buyout of locomotives and freight cars under long-term operating leases, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions. lower capital investments in locomotives and freight cars in 2013 drove the decrease in cash used in investing activities compared to 2012. included in capital investments in 2012 was $75 million for the early buyout of 165 locomotives under long-term operating and capital leases during the first quarter of 2012, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions..

what was the value included in the capital investments for buyout of locomotives in 2012, in dollars? 75000000.0

statutory net income | $2430 | $2369 | $2196 | $1047 | $904 | $818

as permitted by the restructuring discussed previously in note 7, certain of the company 2019s u.s. subsidiaries discount certain a&e liabilities, which increased statutory capital and surplus by approximately $206 million, $215 million, and $211 million at december 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. the company 2019s international subsidiaries prepare statutory financial statements based on local laws and regulations. some jurisdictions impose complex regulatory requirements on insurance companies while other jurisdictions impose fewer requirements. in some countries, the company must obtain licenses issued by governmental authorities to conduct local insurance business. these licenses may be subject to reserves and minimum capital and solvency tests. jurisdictions may impose fines, censure, and/or criminal sanctions for violation of regulatory requirements..

what was the amount of statutory capital and surplus for bermuda subsidiaries in 2010? 11798.0

in 2007, we expect our total capital investments to be approximately $3.2 billion, which may include long- term leases. these investments will be used to maintain track and structures, continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors, remove bottlenecks, upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs, build and improve facilities and terminals, and develop and implement new technologies. we designed these investments to maintain infrastructure for safety, enhance customer service, promote growth, and improve operational fluidity. we expect to fund our 2007 cash capital investments through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, and cash on hand at december 31, 2006. we expect that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet our expected capital requirements for 2007. for the years ended december 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 4.4, 2.9, and 2.1, respectively. the increases in 2006 and 2005 were driven by higher net income. the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis. earnings represent income from continuing operations, less equity earnings net of distributions, plus fixed charges and income taxes. fixed charges represent interest charges, amortization of debt discount, and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges. see exhibit 12 for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges. financing activities credit facilities 2013 on december 31, 2006, we had $2 billion in revolving credit facilities available, including $1 billion under a five-year facility expiring in march 2009 and $1 billion under a five-year facility expiring in march 2010 (collectively, the "facilities"). the facilities are designated for general corporate purposes and support the issuance of commercial paper. neither of the facilities were drawn on in 2006. commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment-grade borrowers. these facilities allow for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates, plus a spread, depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings. the facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth and a debt to net worth coverage ratio. at december 31, 2006, we were in compliance with these covenants. the facilities do not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require the posting of collateral. in addition to our revolving credit facilities, we had $150 million in uncommitted lines of credit available, including $75 million that expires in march 2007 and $75 million expiring in may 2007. neither of these lines of credit were used as of december 31, 2006. we must have equivalent credit available under our five-year facilities to draw on these $75 million lines. dividends 2013 on january 30, 2007, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share, payable beginning on april 2, 2007, to shareholders of record on february 28, 2007. we expect to fund the increase in the quarterly dividend through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, and cash on hand at december 31, 2006. dividend restrictions 2013 we are subject to certain restrictions related to the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders due to minimum net worth requirements under our credit facilities. retained earnings available.

2007 compared with 2006 total net revenue of $71.4 billion was up $9.4 billion, or 15% (15%), from the prior year. higher net interest income, very strong private equity gains, record asset management, administration and commissions revenue, higher mortgage fees and related income and record investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth. these increases were offset partially by lower trading revenue. investment banking fees grew in 2007 to a level higher than the pre- vious record set in 2006. record advisory and equity underwriting fees drove the results, partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees. for a further discussion of investment banking fees, which are primarily recorded in ib, see the ib segment results on pages 40 201342 of this annual report. principal transactions revenue consists of trading revenue and private equity gains. trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006 level, primarily due to markdowns in ib of $1.4 billion (net of hedges) on subprime positions, including subprime cdos, and $1.3 billion (net of fees) on leveraged lending funded loans and unfunded commitments. also in ib, markdowns in securitized products on nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading performance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong revenue in both rates and equities. equities benefited from strong client activity and record trading results across all products. ib 2019s credit portfolio results increased compared with the prior year, primarily driven by higher revenue from risk management activities. the increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains, the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments resulting from the adoption of sfas 157 (201cfair value measurements 201d). for a further discussion of principal transactions revenue, see the ib and corporate segment results on pages 40 201342 and 59 201360, respectively, and note 6 on page 122 of this annual report. lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level, driven pri- marily by higher deposit-related fees and the bank of new york transaction. for a further discussion of lending & deposit-related fees, which are mostly recorded in rfs, tss and cb, see the rfs segment results on pages 43 201348, the tss segment results on pages 54 201355, and the cb segment results on pages 52 201353 of this annual report. asset management, administration and commissions revenue reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006. increased assets under management and higher performance and placement fees in am drove the record results. the 18% (18%) growth in assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset inflows and market appreciation across all segments: institutional, retail, private bank and private client services. tss also contributed to the rise in asset management, administration and commissions revenue, driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody. finally, commissions revenue increased, due mainly to higher brokerage transaction volume (primarily included within fixed income and equity markets revenue of ib), which more than offset the sale of the insurance business by rfs in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuities. for additional information on these fees and commissions, see the segment discussions for ib on pages 40 201342, rfs on pages 43 201348, tss on pages 54 201355, and am on pages 56 201358, of this annual report. the favorable variance resulting from securities gains in 2007 compared with securities losses in 2006 was primarily driven by improvements in the results of repositioning of the treasury invest- ment securities portfolio. also contributing to the positive variance was a $234 million gain from the sale of mastercard shares. for a fur- ther discussion of securities gains (losses), which are mostly recorded in the firm 2019s treasury business, see the corporate segment discussion on pages 59 201360 of this annual report. consol idated results of operat ions.

as of december 31, 2017, there were 0.5 million repurchased shares pending settlement and $33.8 million was unpaid and included within other accrued liabilities. in october 2017, our board of directors added $2.0 billion to the existing share repurchase authorization that now extends through december 31, 2020. before this, $98.4 million remained under a prior authorization. share repurchases under the program may be made through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. while the board of directors has approved the program, the timing of any purchases, the prices and the number of shares of common stock to be purchased will be determined by our management, at its discretion, and will depend upon market conditions and other factors. the share repurchase program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time. as of december 31, 2017, the remaining authorized purchase capacity under our october 2017 repurchase program was $1.8 billion. in december 2015, our board of directors changed the status of 71272964 treasury shares to authorized and unissued. in doing so, the number of our issued shares was reduced by the stated amount. our accounting policy is to deduct the par value from common stock and to reflect the excess of cost over par value as a deduction from additional paid-in capital. the change in unissued shares resulted in a reduction of $2295.3 million in treasury stock, $0.6 million in common stock, and $2294.7 million in additional paid-in capital. there was no effect on our total stockholders 2019 equity position as a result of the change. dividends in october 2017, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.345 per share. cash dividends declared were $446.3 million, $423.8 million and $404.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. as of december 31, 2017, we recorded a quarterly dividend payable of $114.4 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 2, 2018. 13. earnings per share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to republic services, inc. by the weighted average number of common shares (including vested but unissued rsus) outstanding during the.

impairment net unrealized losses on securities available for sale were as follows as of december 31:.

fair value | $72699 | $54163
amortized cost | 74843 | 60786
net unrealized loss pre-tax | $-2144 (2144) | $-6623 (6623)
net unrealized loss after-tax | $-1316 (1316) | $-4057 (4057)

the above net unrealized loss amounts at december 31, 2009 and december 31, 2008 excluded the remaining net unrealized loss of $1.01 billion, or $635 million after-tax, and $2.27 billion, or $1.39 billion after- tax, respectively, related to reclassifications of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity. these after-tax amounts are recorded in other comprehensive income. the decline in the remaining after-tax unrealized loss amounts related to transferred securities resulted from amortization and from the recognition of losses from other-than-temporary impairment on certain of the securities. we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether other-than-temporary impairment exists. to the extent that other-than-temporary impairment is identified, the impairment is broken into a credit component and a non-credit component. the credit component is recognized in our consolidated statement of income, and the non-credit component is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that management does not intend to sell the security (see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8). the assessment of other-than-temporary impairment involves an evaluation of economic and security- specific factors, which are more fully described in note 3. such factors are based upon estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance. to the extent that market conditions are worse than management 2019s expectations, other-than-temporary impairment could increase, in particular the credit component that would be recognized in our consolidated statement of income. national housing prices, according to the case-shiller national hpi, have declined to date approximately 30% (30%) peak-to-current. management currently estimates that national housing prices will continue to decline and bottom out during the second half of 2010, consistent with a peak-to-trough housing price decline of approximately 37% (37%). as an indication of the sensitivity of our portfolio with respect to our more significant assumptions underlying our assessment of impairment, if we were to increase our default estimates to 110% (110%) of management 2019s current expectations with a corresponding slowing of prepayment speeds to 90% (90%) of management 2019s current expectations, credit-related other-than-temporary impairment could increase by approximately $120 million to $125 million, which impairment would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income. excluding the securities for which other-than-temporary impairment was recorded, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining securities and the resulting net unrealized losses to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. additional information about our assessment of impairment is provided in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8..

as noted previously, we also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit plans to provide benefits in excess of qualified plan limits. the aggregate liabilities for these plans at december 31, 2006 were $641 million. the expense associated with these plans totaled $59 million in 2006, $58 million in 2005 and $61 million in 2004. we also sponsor a small number of foreign benefit plans. the liabilities and expenses associated with these plans are not material to our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. note 13 2013 leases our total rental expense under operating leases was $310 million, $324 million and $318 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. future minimum lease commitments at december 31, 2006 for all operating leases that have a remaining term of more than one year were $1.1 billion ($288 million in 2007, $254 million in 2008, $211 million in 2009, $153 million in 2010, $118 million in 2011 and $121 million in later years). certain major plant facilities and equipment are furnished by the u.s. government under short-term or cancelable arrangements. note 14 2013 legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies we are a party to or have property subject to litigation and other proceedings, including matters arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. we believe the probability is remote that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the corporation as a whole. we cannot predict the outcome of legal proceedings with certainty. these matters include the following items, all of which have been previously reported: on march 27, 2006, we received a subpoena issued by a grand jury in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio. the subpoena requests documents related to our application for patents issued in the united states and the united kingdom relating to a missile detection and warning technology. we are cooperating with the government 2019s investigation. on february 6, 2004, we submitted a certified contract claim to the united states requesting contractual indemnity for remediation and litigation costs (past and future) related to our former facility in redlands, california. we submitted the claim consistent with a claim sponsorship agreement with the boeing company (boeing), executed in 2001, in boeing 2019s role as the prime contractor on the short range attack missile (sram) program. the contract for the sram program, which formed a significant portion of our work at the redlands facility, had special contractual indemnities from the u.s. air force, as authorized by public law 85-804. on august 31, 2004, the united states denied the claim. our appeal of that decision is pending with the armed services board of contract appeals. on august 28, 2003, the department of justice (the doj) filed complaints in partial intervention in two lawsuits filed under the qui tam provisions of the civil false claims act in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky, united states ex rel. natural resources defense council, et al v. lockheed martin corporation, et al, and united states ex rel. john d. tillson v. lockheed martin energy systems, inc., et al. the doj alleges that we committed violations of the resource conservation and recovery act at the paducah gaseous diffusion plant by not properly handling, storing.

we hold an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our $375 million 5.0% (5.0%) senior unsecured notes due july 1, 2014. the effect of the swap is to convert our 5.0% (5.0%) fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the three-month libor plus 2.05% (2.05%) (2.42% (2.42%) as of october 29, 2011). in addition, we have a term loan facility of $145 million that bears interest at a fluctuating rate for each period equal to the libor rate corresponding with the tenor of the interest period plus a spread of 1.25% (1.25%) (1.61% (1.61%) as of october 29, 2011). if libor increases by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $5 million. however, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on our $375 million of 3% (3%) fixed-rate debt, which is not hedged. as of october 30, 2010, a similar 100 basis point increase in libor would have resulted in an increase of approximately $4 million to our annual interest expense. foreign currency exposure as more fully described in note 2i in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we regularly hedge our non-u.s. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro, primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 29, 2011 and october 30, 2010, a 10% (10%) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately $6 million in losses in earnings or cash flows. the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of october 29, 2011, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. the amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties 2019 obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties. the following table illustrates the effect that a 10% (10%) unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the u.s. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october 29, 2011 and october 30, 2010:.

the analysis of our depreciation studies. changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively. under group depreciation, the historical cost (net of salvage) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using (i) inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and (ii) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies. the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes. because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired, we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate. in addition, we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies. any deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets. for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions: (i) is unusual, (ii) is material in amount, and (iii) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies. a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations. when we purchase an asset, we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use. however, many of our assets are self-constructed. a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties, which is typically performed by our employees, and for track line expansion and other capacity projects. costs that are directly attributable to capital projects (including overhead costs) are capitalized. direct costs that are capitalized as part of self- constructed assets include material, labor, and work equipment. indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset. general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred. normal repairs and maintenance are also expensed as incurred, while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset, improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized. these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases. total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $2.4 billion for 2014, $2.3 billion for 2013, and $2.1 billion for 2012. assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease. 13. accounts payable and other current liabilities dec. 31, dec. 31, millions 2014 2013.

- | amount (in millions)
2007 net revenue | $231.0
volume/weather | 15.5
net gas revenue | 6.6
rider revenue | 3.9
base revenue | -11.3 (11.3)
other | 7.0
2008 net revenue | $252.7

the volume/weather variance is due to an increase in electricity usage in the service territory in 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. entergy new orleans estimates that approximately 141000 electric customers and 93000 gas customers have returned since hurricane katrina and are taking service as of december 31, 2008, compared to approximately 132000 electric customers and 86000 gas customers as of december 31, 2007. billed retail electricity usage increased a total of 184 gwh compared to the same period in 2007, an increase of 4% (4%). the net gas revenue variance is primarily due to an increase in base rates in march and november 2007. refer to note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the base rate increase. the rider revenue variance is due primarily to higher total revenue and a storm reserve rider effective march 2007 as a result of the city council's approval of a settlement agreement in october 2006. the approved storm reserve has been set to collect $75 million over a ten-year period through the rider and the funds will be held in a restricted escrow account. the settlement agreement is discussed in note 2 to the financial statements. the base revenue variance is primarily due to a base rate recovery credit, effective january 2008. the base rate credit is discussed in note 2 to the financial statements. gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses gross operating revenues increased primarily due to: an increase of $58.9 million in gross wholesale revenue due to increased sales to affiliated customers and an increase in the average price of energy available for resale sales; an increase of $47.7 million in electric fuel cost recovery revenues due to higher fuel rates and increased electricity usage; and an increase of $22 million in gross gas revenues due to higher fuel recovery revenues and increases in gas base rates in march 2007 and november 2007. fuel and purchased power increased primarily due to increases in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power in addition to an increase in demand..

what was the increase observed in the net revenue from 2007 to 2008? 21.7

what was that net revenue in 2007? 231.0

item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (amounts in millions) in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. from time to time, we use derivative instruments, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations. the majority of our debt (approximately 89% (89%) and 91% (91%) as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively) bears interest at fixed rates. we do have debt with variable interest rates, but a 10% (10%) increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows. the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates, and the impact of a 10% (10%) change in interest rates is summarized below. increase/ (decrease) in fair market value as of december 31, 10% (10%) increase in interest rates 10% (10%) decrease in interest rates.

as of december 31, | increase/ (decrease) in fair market value 10% (10%) increasein interest rates | increase/ (decrease) in fair market value 10% (10%) decreasein interest rates
2015 | $-33.7 (33.7) | $34.7
2014 | -35.5 (35.5) | 36.6

we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31, 2015. we had $1509.7 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31, 2015 that we generally invest in conservative, short-term bank deposits or securities. the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. during 2015 and 2014, we had interest income of $22.8 and $27.4, respectively. based on our 2015 results, a 100-basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $15.0, assuming that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2015 levels. foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2015 included the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling and euro. based on 2015 exchange rates and operating results, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10% (10%), we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4% (4%), assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2015 levels. the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, in the stockholders 2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. however, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures. we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes..

what is the net change in value of interest income from 2014 to 2015?

2014 compared to 2013 mst 2019s net sales decreased $305 million, or 3% (3%), in 2014 as compared to 2013. net sales decreased by approximately $305 million due to the wind-down or completion of certain c4isr programs (primarily ptds); about $85 million for undersea systems programs due to decreased volume and deliveries; and about $55 million related to the settlements of contract cost matters on certain programs in 2013 that were not repeated in 2014 (including a portion of the terminated presidential helicopter program). the decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $80 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors programs due to increased volume (primarily space fence); and approximately $40 million for training and logistics solutions programs due to increased deliveries (primarily close combat tactical trainer). mst 2019s operating profit decreased $129 million, or 12% (12%), in 2014 as compared to 2013. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $120 million related to the settlements of contract cost matters on certain programs in 2013 that were not repeated in 2014 (including a portion of the terminated presidential helicopter program); approximately $55 million due to the reasons described above for lower c4isr program sales, as well as performance matters on an international program; and approximately $45 million due to higher reserves recorded on certain training and logistics solutions programs. the decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $45 million for performance matters and reserves recorded in 2013 that were not repeated in 2014; and about $60 million for various programs due to increased risk retirements (including mh-60 and radar surveillance programs). adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $85 million lower for 2014 compared to 2013. backlog backlog increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the addition of sikorsky backlog, as well as higher orders on new program starts (such as australian defence force pilot training system). backlog increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher orders on new program starts (such as space fence). trends we expect mst 2019s 2016 net sales to increase in the mid-double digit percentage range compared to 2015 net sales due to the inclusion of sikorsky programs for a full year, partially offset by a decline in volume due to the wind-down or completion of certain programs. operating profit is expected to be equivalent to 2015 on higher volume, and operating margin is expected to decline due to costs associated with the sikorsky acquisition, including the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, integration costs and inherited restructuring costs associated with actions committed to by sikorsky prior to acquisition. space systems our space systems business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems. space systems provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. space systems is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. space systems 2019 major programs include the trident ii d5 fleet ballistic missile (fbm), orion, space based infrared system (sbirs), aehf, gps-iii, geostationary operational environmental satellite r-series (goes-r), and muos. operating profit for our space systems business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in ula, which provides expendable launch services to the u.s. government. space systems 2019 operating results included the following (in millions):.

- | 2015 | 2014 | 2013

operating margins | 12.9% (12.9%) | 12.9% (12.9%) | 12.9% (12.9%)
backlog at year-end | $17400 | $20300 | $21400

2015 compared to 2014 space systems 2019 net sales in 2015 decreased $97 million, or 1% (1%), compared to 2014. the decrease was attributable to approximately $335 million lower net sales for government satellite programs due to decreased volume (primarily aehf) and the wind-down or completion of mission solutions programs; and approximately $55 million for strategic missile and defense systems due to lower volume. these decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $235 million for businesses acquired in 2014; and approximately $75 million for the orion program due to increased volume..

62 general mills amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss unrealized losses from interest rate cash flow hedges recorded in aoci as of may 27, 2012, totaled $73.6 million after tax. these deferred losses are primarily related to interest rate swaps that we entered into in contemplation of future borrowings and other financ- ing requirements and that are being reclassified into net interest over the lives of the hedged forecasted transac- tions. unrealized losses from foreign currency cash flow hedges recorded in aoci as of may 27, 2012, were $1.7 million after-tax. the net amount of pre-tax gains and losses in aoci as of may 27, 2012, that we expect to be reclassified into net earnings within the next 12 months is $14.0 million of expense. credit-risk-related contingent features certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from each of the major credit rat- ing agencies. if our debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization on derivative instru- ments in net liability positions. the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on may 27, 2012, was $19.9 million. we have posted col- lateral of $4.3 million in the normal course of business associated with these contracts. if the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on may 27, 2012, we would have been required to post an additional $15.6 million of collateral to counterparties. concentrations of credit and counterparty credit risk during fiscal 2012, wal-mart stores, inc. and its affili- ates (wal-mart) accounted for 22 percent of our con- solidated net sales and 30 percent of our net sales in the u.s. retail segment. no other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. wal- mart also represented 6 percent of our net sales in the international segment and 7 percent of our net sales in the bakeries and foodservice segment. as of may 27, 2012, wal-mart accounted for 26 percent of our u.s. retail receivables, 5 percent of our international receiv- ables, and 9 percent of our bakeries and foodservice receivables. the five largest customers in our u.s. retail segment accounted for 54 percent of its fiscal 2012 net sales, the five largest customers in our international segment accounted for 26 percent of its fiscal 2012 net sales, and the five largest customers in our bakeries and foodservice segment accounted for 46 percent of its fis- cal 2012 net sales. we enter into interest rate, foreign exchange, and cer- tain commodity and equity derivatives, primarily with a diversified group of highly rated counterparties. we continually monitor our positions and the credit rat- ings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one party. these transactions may expose us to potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these counterparties; however, we have not incurred a material loss. we also enter into commodity futures transactions through vari- ous regulated exchanges. the amount of loss due to the credit risk of the coun- terparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the contracts, is $19.5 million against which we do not hold collateral. under the terms of master swap agreements, some of our transactions require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to threshold levels of exposure and counterparty credit risk. collateral assets are either cash or u.s. treasury instruments and are held in a trust account that we may access if the counterparty defaults. note 8. debt notes payable the components of notes payable and their respective weighted-average interest rates at the end of the periods were as follows:.

impairment the following table presents net unrealized losses on securities available for sale as of december 31:.

fair value | $99832 | $81881
amortized cost | 100013 | 82329
net unrealized loss pre-tax | $-181 (181) | $-448 (448)
net unrealized loss after-tax | $-113 (113) | $-270 (270)

the net unrealized amounts presented above excluded the remaining net unrealized losses related to reclassifications of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity. these unrealized losses related to reclassifications totaled $303 million, or $189 million after-tax, and $523 million, or $317 million after-tax, as of december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, or oci. refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8. the decline in these remaining after-tax unrealized losses related to reclassifications from december 31, 2010 to december 31, 2011 resulted primarily from amortization. we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether other-than-temporary impairment exists. to the extent that other-than-temporary impairment is identified, the impairment is broken into a credit component and a non-credit component. the credit component is recorded in our consolidated statement of income, and the non-credit component is recorded in oci to the extent that we do not intend to sell the security. our assessment of other-than-temporary impairment involves an evaluation, more fully described in note 3, of economic and security-specific factors. such factors are based on estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance. to the extent that market conditions are worse than management 2019s expectations, other-than-temporary impairment could increase, in particular, the credit component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income. given the exposure of our investment securities portfolio, particularly mortgage- and asset-backed securities, to residential mortgage and other consumer credit risks, the performance of the u.s. housing market is a significant driver of the portfolio 2019s credit performance. as such, our assessment of other-than-temporary impairment relies to a significant extent on our estimates of trends in national housing prices. generally, indices that measure trends in national housing prices are published in arrears. as of september 30, 2011, national housing prices, according to the case-shiller national home price index, had declined by approximately 31.3% (31.3%) peak-to-current. overall, management 2019s expectation, for purposes of its evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment as of december 31, 2011, was that housing prices would decline by approximately 35% (35%) peak-to-trough. the performance of certain mortgage products and vintages of securities continues to deteriorate. in addition, management continues to believe that housing prices will decline further as indicated above. the combination of these factors has led to an increase in management 2019s overall loss expectations. our investment portfolio continues to be sensitive to management 2019s estimates of future cumulative losses. ultimately, other-than- temporary impairment is based on specific cusip-level detailed analysis of the unique characteristics of each security. in addition, we perform sensitivity analysis across each significant product type within the non-agency u.s. residential mortgage-backed portfolio. we estimate, for example, that other-than-temporary impairment of the investment portfolio could increase by approximately $10 million to $50 million, if national housing prices were to decline by 37% (37%) to 39% (39%) peak-to-trough, compared to management 2019s expectation of 35% (35%) described above. this sensitivity estimate is based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of housing prices and the timing of defaults. to the extent that such factors differ substantially from management 2019s current expectations, resulting loss estimates may differ materially from those stated. excluding the securities for which other-than-temporary impairment was recorded in 2011, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining.

the analysis of our depreciation studies. changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively. under group depreciation, the historical cost (net of salvage) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using (i) inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and (ii) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies. the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes. because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired, we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate. in addition, we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies. any deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets. for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions: (i) is unusual, (ii) is material in amount, and (iii) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies. a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations. when we purchase an asset, we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use. however, many of our assets are self-constructed. a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties, which is typically performed by our employees, and for track line expansion and other capacity projects. costs that are directly attributable to capital projects (including overhead costs) are capitalized. direct costs that are capitalized as part of self- constructed assets include material, labor, and work equipment. indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset. general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred. normal repairs and maintenance are also expensed as incurred, while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset, improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized. these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases. total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $2.4 billion for 2014, $2.3 billion for 2013, and $2.1 billion for 2012. assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease. 13. accounts payable and other current liabilities dec. 31, dec. 31, millions 2014 2013.

item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (amounts in millions) in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. from time to time, we use derivative instruments, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations. the majority of our debt (approximately 89% (89%) and 91% (91%) as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively) bears interest at fixed rates. we do have debt with variable interest rates, but a 10% (10%) increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows. the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates, and the impact of a 10% (10%) change in interest rates is summarized below. increase/ (decrease) in fair market value as of december 31, 10% (10%) increase in interest rates 10% (10%) decrease in interest rates.

as of december 31, | increase/ (decrease) in fair market value 10% (10%) increasein interest rates | increase/ (decrease) in fair market value 10% (10%) decreasein interest rates

2014 | -35.5 (35.5) | 36.6

we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31, 2015. we had $1509.7 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31, 2015 that we generally invest in conservative, short-term bank deposits or securities. the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. during 2015 and 2014, we had interest income of $22.8 and $27.4, respectively. based on our 2015 results, a 100-basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $15.0, assuming that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2015 levels. foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2015 included the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling and euro. based on 2015 exchange rates and operating results, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10% (10%), we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4% (4%), assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2015 levels. the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, in the stockholders 2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. however, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures. we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes..

mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts total mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts (trust preferred securities), which qualify as tier 1 capital, were $23.899 billion at december 31, 2008, as compared to $23.594 billion at december 31, 2007. in 2008, citigroup did not issue any new enhanced trust preferred securities. the frb issued a final rule, with an effective date of april 11, 2005, which retains trust preferred securities in tier 1 capital of bank holding companies, but with stricter quantitative limits and clearer qualitative standards. under the rule, after a five-year transition period, the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other restricted core capital elements included in tier 1 capital of internationally active banking organizations, such as citigroup, would be limited to 15% (15%) of total core capital elements, net of goodwill, less any associated deferred tax liability. the amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit could be included in tier 2 capital, subject to restrictions. at december 31, 2008, citigroup had approximately 11.8% (11.8%) against the limit. the company expects to be within restricted core capital limits prior to the implementation date of march 31, 2009. the frb permits additional securities, such as the equity units sold to adia, to be included in tier 1 capital up to 25% (25%) (including the restricted core capital elements in the 15% (15%) limit) of total core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability. at december 31, 2008, citigroup had approximately 16.1% (16.1%) against the limit. the frb granted interim capital relief for the impact of adopting sfas 158 at december 31, 2008 and december 31, 2007. the frb and the ffiec may propose amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital guidelines and reporting instructions. these may affect reported capital ratios and net risk-weighted assets. capital resources of citigroup 2019s depository institutions citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions in the united states are subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by their respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the frb 2019s guidelines. to be 201cwell capitalized 201d under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, citigroup 2019s depository institutions must have a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6% (6%), a total capital (tier 1 + tier 2 capital) ratio of at least 10% (10%) and a leverage ratio of at least 5% (5%), and not be subject to a regulatory directive to meet and maintain higher capital levels. at december 31, 2008, all of citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions were 201cwell capitalized 201d under the federal regulatory agencies 2019 definitions, including citigroup 2019s primary depository institution, citibank, n.a., as noted in the following table: citibank, n.a. components of capital and ratios under regulatory guidelines in billions of dollars at year end 2008 2007.

1 reflects net income adjusted primarily for depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangible assets, amortization of restricted stock and other non-cash compensation, non-cash (gain) loss related to early extinguishment of debt, losses on sales of businesses and deferred income taxes. 2 reflects changes in accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during 2015 was $674.0, which was an improvement of $4.5 as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of an improvement in working capital usage of $13.6. due to the seasonality of our business, we typically generate cash from working capital in the second half of a year and use cash from working capital in the first half of a year, with the largest impacts in the first and fourth quarters. our net working capital usage in 2015 was primarily attributable to our media businesses. net cash provided by operating activities during 2014 was $669.5, which was an improvement of $76.6 as compared to 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in net income, offset by an increase in working capital usage of $121.5. our net working capital usage in 2014 was impacted by our media businesses. the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow. in most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. to the extent possible, we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients. the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these pass-through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers. our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments. for example, while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year, they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year. investing activities net cash used in investing activities during 2015 primarily related to payments for capital expenditures of $161.1, largely attributable to purchases of leasehold improvements and computer hardware. net cash used in investing activities during 2014 primarily related to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions. capital expenditures of $148.7 related primarily to computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements. we made payments of $67.8 related to acquisitions completed during 2014, net of cash acquired..

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently under examination by the relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded. while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe we have appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits. however, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty. it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material, but cannot be estimated as of december 31, 2016. our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted. 22. discontinued operations brazil distribution 2014 due to a portfolio evaluation in the first half of 2016, management has decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distribution companies in brazil, aes sul and eletropaulo. the disposal of sul was completed in october 2016. in december 2016, eletropaulo underwent a corporate restructuring which is expected to, among other things, provide more liquidity of its shares. aes is continuing to pursue strategic options for eletropaulo in order to complete its strategic shift to reduce aes 2019 exposure to the brazilian distribution business, including preparation for listing its shares into the novo mercado, which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance. the company executed an agreement for the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary aes sul in june 2016. we have reported the results of operations and financial position of aes sul as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria, the company recognized an after tax loss of $382 million comprised of a pretax impairment charge of $783 million, offset by a tax benefit of $266 million related to the impairment of the sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $135 million for deferred taxes related to the investment in aes sul. prior to the impairment charge in the second quarter, the carrying value of the aes sul asset group of $1.6 billion was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell. however, the impairment charge was limited to the carrying value of the long lived assets of the aes sul disposal group. on october 31, 2016, the company completed the sale of aes sul and received final proceeds less costs to sell of $484 million, excluding contingent consideration. upon disposal of aes sul, we incurred an additional after- tax loss on sale of $737 million. the cumulative impact to earnings of the impairment and loss on sale was $1.1 billion. this includes the reclassification of approximately $1 billion of cumulative translation losses, resulting in a net reduction to the company 2019s stockholders 2019 equity of $92 million. sul 2019s pretax loss attributable to aes for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1.4 billion and $32 million, respectively. sul 2019s pretax gain attributable to aes for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $133 million. prior to its classification as discontinued operations, sul was reported in the brazil sbu reportable segment. as discussed in note 1 2014general and summary of significant accounting policies, effective july 1, 2014, the company prospectively adopted asu no. 2014-08. discontinued operations prior to adoption of asu no. 2014-08 include the results of cameroon, saurashtra and various u.s. wind projects which were each sold in the first half of cameroon 2014 in september 2013, the company executed agreements for the sale of its 56% (56%) equity interests in businesses in cameroon: sonel, an integrated utility, kribi, a gas and light fuel oil plant, and dibamba, a heavy.

during 2009, the company converted its stock administration system to a new service provider. in connection with this conversion, a reconciliation of the methodologies and estimates utilized was performed, which resulted in a $12 million reduction of expense for the year ended december 31, 2009. stock awards stock awards, in the form of rsus, are granted to certain employees and consist of both performance-based and service-based rsus. service-based awards generally vest between three and ten years from the date of grant. the fair value of service-based awards is based upon the market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant. with certain limited exceptions, any break in continuous employment will cause the forfeiture of all unvested awards. compensation expense associated with stock awards is recognized over the service period. dividend equivalents are paid on certain service-based rsus, based on the initial grant amount. performance-based rsus have been granted to certain employees. vesting of these awards is contingent upon meeting various individual, divisional or company-wide performance conditions, including revenue generation or growth in revenue, pretax income or earnings per share over a one- to five-year period. the performance conditions are not considered in the determination of the grant date fair value for these awards. the fair value of performance-based awards is based upon the market price of the underlying common stock at the date of grant. compensation expense is recognized over the performance period, and in certain cases an additional vesting period, based on management 2019s estimate of the number of units expected to vest. compensation expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares paid out at the end of the programs. the actual payout of shares under these performance- based plans may range from 0-200% (0-200%) of the number of units granted, based on the plan. dividend equivalents are generally not paid on the performance-based rsus. during 2010, the company granted approximately 1.6 million shares in connection with the completion of the 2007 leadership performance plan (2018 2018lpp 2019 2019) cycle and 84000 shares related to other performance plans. during 2010, 2009 and 2008, the company granted approximately 3.5 million.

(a) additions include acquisitions. (b) during 2011, the company reclassified the goodwill related to the business units held for sale. subsequent to the reclassification, the company recognized a charge for those business units expected to be divested at a loss; the charge included a write-down of goodwill of $13 million. (c) other principally includes the effect of foreign currency translation and purchase price adjustments related to prior-year acquisitions. in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011, the company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. the impairment test in 2012 indicated there was no impairment of goodwill for any of the company 2019s reporting units. the impairment test in 2011 indicated that goodwill recorded for certain of the company 2019s reporting units was impaired. the company recognized the non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges, in continuing operations, for goodwill of $486 million ($330 million, after tax) for 2011. in 2011, the pre-tax impairment charge in the cabinets and related products segment relates to the european ready-to- assemble cabinet manufacturer and reflects the declining demand for certain products, as well as decreased operating margins. the pre-tax impairment charge in the decorative architectural products segment relates to the builders 2019 hardware business and reflects increasing competitive conditions for that business. the pre-tax impairment charge in the other specialty products segment relates to the north american window and door business and reflects the continuing weak level of new home construction activity in the western u.s., the reduced levels of repair and remodel activity and the expectation that recovery in these segments will be modestly slower than anticipated. the company then assessed the long-lived assets associated with these business units and determined no impairment was necessary at december 31, 2011. other indefinite-lived intangible assets were $132 million and $174 million at december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and principally included registered trademarks. in 2012 and 2011, the impairment test indicated that the registered trademark for a north american business unit in the other specialty products segment and the registered trademark for a north american business unit in the plumbing products segment (2011 only) were impaired due to changes in the long-term outlook for the business units. the company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for other indefinite- lived intangible assets of $42 million ($27 million, after tax) and $8 million ($5 million, after tax) in 2012 and 2011, respectively. in 2010, the company recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $10 million ($6 million after tax) related to the installation and other services segment ($9 million pre-tax) and the plumbing products segment ($1 million pre-tax)..

generally, our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period, followed by a 20 year amortization term. during the draw period, we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay interest only and home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay principal and interest. based upon outstanding balances at december 31, 2011, the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end. home equity lines of credit - draw period end dates in millions interest only product principal and interest product.

(a) includes approximately $306 million, $44 million, $60 million, $100 million, and $246 million of home equity lines of credit with balloon payments with draw periods scheduled to end in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 and thereafter, respectively. we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only, as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments. based upon outstanding balances, and excluding purchased impaired loans, at december 31, 2011, for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw (e.g., draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated), approximately 4.32% (4.32%) were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5.57% (5.57%) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due. generally, when a borrower becomes 60 days past due, we terminate borrowing privileges, and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated. at that point, we continue our collection/recovery processes, which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr. see note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information. loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure, where appropriate. initially, a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program. if a borrower does not qualify under a government program, the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program. our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate, extend the term and/or defer principal. temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs. further, certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as tdrs. additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. a temporary modification, with a term between three and 60 months, involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to the original loan terms as of a specific date or the occurrence of an event, such as a failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the modification. typically, these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate. a permanent modification, with a term greater than 60 months, is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed. permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program (hamp) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs. for consumer loan programs, such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines, we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance. examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family, or a loss of employment. permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount, but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made. residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60 months, although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months. we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers 2019 needs while mitigating credit losses. the following tables provide the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans as well as the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified loans that were 60 days or more past due as of six months, nine months and twelve months after the modification date. 78 the pnc financial services group, inc. 2013 form 10-k.

operating activities cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower net income and changes in working capital, partially offset by the timing of tax payments. federal tax law provided for 100% (100%) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50% (50%) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012-2013. as a result, the company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011-2013 income tax expense, contributing to the positive operating cash flow in those years. congress extended 50% (50%) bonus depreciation for 2014, but this extension occurred in december, and the related benefit was realized in 2015, rather than 2014. similarly, in december of 2015, congress extended bonus depreciation through 2019, which delayed the benefit of 2015 bonus depreciation into 2016. bonus depreciation will be at a rate of 50% (50%) for 2015, 2016 and 2017, 40% (40%) for 2018 and 30% (30%) for 2019. higher net income in 2014 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2013, despite higher income tax payments. 2014 income tax payments were higher than 2013 primarily due to higher income, but also because we paid taxes previously deferred by bonus depreciation. investing activities higher capital investments in locomotives and freight cars, including $327 million in early lease buyouts, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions, drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014. higher capital investments, including the early buyout of the long-term operating lease of our headquarters building for approximately $261 million, drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013. significant investments also were made for new locomotives, freight cars and containers, and capacity and commercial facility projects. capital investments in 2014 also included $99 million for the early buyout of locomotives and freight cars under long-term operating leases, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions..

2011 compared to 2010 mst 2019s net sales for 2011 decreased $311 million, or 4% (4%), compared to 2010. the decrease was attributable to decreased volume of approximately $390 million for certain ship and aviation system programs (primarily maritime patrol aircraft and ptds) and approximately $75 million for training and logistics solutions programs. partially offsetting these decreases was higher sales of about $165 million from production on the lcs program. mst 2019s operating profit for 2011 decreased $68 million, or 10% (10%), compared to 2010. the decrease was attributable to decreased operating profit of approximately $55 million as a result of increased reserves for contract cost matters on various ship and aviation system programs (including the terminated presidential helicopter program) and approximately $40 million due to lower volume and increased reserves on training and logistics solutions. partially offsetting these decreases was higher operating profit of approximately $30 million in 2011 primarily due to the recognition of reserves on certain undersea systems programs in 2010. adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments described above, were approximately $55 million lower in 2011 compared to 2010. backlog backlog increased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to increased orders on ship and aviation system programs (primarily mh-60 and lcs), partially offset decreased orders and higher sales volume on integrated warfare systems and sensors programs (primarily aegis). backlog decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher sales volume on various integrated warfare systems and sensors programs. trends we expect mst 2019s net sales to decline in 2013 in the low single digit percentage range as compared to 2012 due to the completion of ptds deliveries in 2012 and expected lower volume on training services programs. operating profit and margin are expected to increase slightly from 2012 levels primarily due to anticipated improved contract performance. space systems our space systems business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering, and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems, and space transportation systems. space systems is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. space systems 2019 major programs include the space-based infrared system (sbirs), advanced extremely high frequency (aehf) system, mobile user objective system (muos), global positioning satellite (gps) iii system, geostationary operational environmental satellite r-series (goes-r), trident ii d5 fleet ballistic missile, and orion. operating results for our space systems business segment include our equity interests in united launch alliance (ula), which provides expendable launch services for the u.s. government, united space alliance (usa), which provided processing activities for the space shuttle program and is winding down following the completion of the last space shuttle mission in 2011, and a joint venture that manages the u.k. 2019s atomic weapons establishment program. space systems 2019 operating results included the following (in millions):.

2012 compared to 2011 space systems 2019 net sales for 2012 increased $186 million, or 2% (2%), compared to 2011. the increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $150 million due to increased commercial satellite deliveries (two commercial satellites delivered in 2012 compared to one during 2011); about $125 million from the orion program due to higher volume and an increase in risk retirements; and approximately $70 million from increased volume on various strategic and defensive missile programs. partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately $105 million from certain government satellite programs (primarily sbirs and muos) as a result of decreased volume and a decline in risk retirements; and about $55 million from the nasa external tank program, which ended in connection with the completion of the space shuttle program in 2011..

the aes corporation notes to consolidated financial statements 2014 (continued) december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was dispatched starting in february 2018. aes puerto rico continues to be the lowest cost and epa compliant energy provider in puerto rico. therefore, we expect aes puerto rico to continue to be a critical supplier to prepa. starting prior to the hurricanes, prepa has been facing economic challenges that could impact the company, and on july 2, 2017, filed for bankruptcy under title iii. as a result of the bankruptcy filing, aes puerto rico and aes ilumina 2019s non-recourse debt of $365 million and $36 million, respectively, is in default and has been classified as current as of december 31, 2017. in november 2017, aes puerto rico signed a forbearance and standstill agreement with its lenders to prevent the lenders from taking any action against the company due to the default events. this agreement will expire on march 22, 2018. the company's receivable balances in puerto rico as of december 31, 2017 totaled $86 million, of which $53 million was overdue. after the filing of title iii protection, and up until the disruption caused by the hurricanes, aes in puerto rico was collecting the overdue amounts from prepa in line with historic payment patterns. considering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carrying amount of our assets in puerto rico of $627 million is recoverable as of december 31, 2017 and no reserve on the receivables is required. foreign currency risks 2014 aes operates businesses in many foreign countries and such operations could be impacted by significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. fluctuations in currency exchange rate between u.s. dollar and the following currencies could create significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows: the argentine peso, the brazilian real, the dominican republic peso, the euro, the chilean peso, the colombian peso, and the philippine peso. concentrations 2014 due to the geographical diversity of its operations, the company does not have any significant concentration of customers or sources of fuel supply. several of the company's generation businesses rely on ppas with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant businesses' output over the term of the ppas. however, no single customer accounted for 10% (10%) or more of total revenue in 2017, 2016 or 2015. the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses depend on the credit quality of our customers and the continued ability of our customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under ppas and fuel supply agreements. if a substantial portion of the company's long-term ppas and/or fuel supply were modified or terminated, the company would be adversely affected to the extent that it would be unable to replace such contracts at equally favorable terms. 26. related party transactions certain of our businesses in panama and the dominican republic are partially owned by governments either directly or through state-owned institutions. in the ordinary course of business, these businesses enter into energy purchase and sale transactions, and transmission agreements with other state-owned institutions which are controlled by such governments. at two of our generation businesses in mexico, the offtakers exercise significant influence, but not control, through representation on these businesses' boards of directors. these offtakers are also required to hold a nominal ownership interest in such businesses. in chile, we provide capacity and energy under contractual arrangements to our investment which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. additionally, the company provides certain support and management services to several of its affiliates under various agreements. the company's consolidated statements of operations included the following transactions with related parties for the periods indicated (in millions):.

entergy texas, inc. management's financial discussion and analysis fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in power purchases as a result of the purchased power agreements between entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy texas and an increase in the average market prices of purchased power and natural gas, substantially offset by a decrease in deferred fuel expense as a result of decreased recovery from customers of fuel costs. other regulatory charges increased primarily due to an increase of $6.9 million in the recovery of bond expenses related to the securitization bonds. the recovery became effective july 2007. see note 5 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization bonds. 2007 compared to 2006 net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2007 to 2006. amount (in millions).

- | amount (in millions)
2006 net revenue | $403.3
purchased power capacity | 13.1
securitization transition charge | 9.9
volume/weather | 9.7
transmission revenue | 6.1
base revenue | 2.6
other | -2.4 (2.4)
2007 net revenue | $442.3

the purchased power capacity variance is due to changes in the purchased power capacity costs included in the calculation in 2007 compared to 2006 used to bill generation costs between entergy texas and entergy gulf states louisiana. the securitization transition charge variance is due to the issuance of securitization bonds. as discussed above, in june 2007, egsrf i, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by entergy texas, issued securitization bonds and with the proceeds purchased from entergy texas the transition property, which is the right to recover from customers through a transition charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds. see note 5 to the financial statements herein for details of the securitization bond issuance. the volume/weather variance is due to increased electricity usage on billed retail sales, including the effects of more favorable weather in 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. the increase is also due to an increase in usage during the unbilled sales period. retail electricity usage increased a total of 139 gwh in all sectors. see "critical accounting estimates" below and note 1 to the financial statements for further discussion of the accounting for unbilled revenues. the transmission revenue variance is due to an increase in rates effective june 2007 and new transmission customers in late 2006. the base revenue variance is due to the transition to competition rider that began in march 2006. refer to note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate increase. gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease of $179 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates and fuel refunds. the decrease was partially offset by the $39 million increase in net revenue described above and an increase of $44 million in wholesale revenues, including $30 million from the system agreement cost equalization payments from entergy arkansas. the receipt of such payments is being.

when we purchase an asset, we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use. however, many of our assets are self-constructed. a large portion of our capital expenditures is for track structure expansion (capacity projects) and replacement (program projects), which is typically performed by our employees. approximately 13% (13%) of our full-time equivalent employees are dedicated to the construction of capital assets. costs that are directly attributable or overhead costs that relate directly to capital projects are capitalized. direct costs that are capitalized as part of self-constructed assets include material, labor, and work equipment. indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset. these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases. the capitalization of indirect costs is consistent with fasb statement no. 67, accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects. general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred. normal repairs and maintenance are also expensed as incurred, while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset, improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized. assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease. 10. accounts payable and other current liabilities dec. 31, dec. 31, millions of dollars 2008 2007.

11. fair value measurements during the first quarter of 2008, we fully adopted fasb statement no. 157, fair value measurements (fas 157). fas 157 established a framework for measuring fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. the adoption of fas 157 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations. fas 157 applies to all assets and liabilities that are measured and reported on a fair value basis. this enables the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. the statement requires that each asset and liability carried at fair value be classified into one of the following categories: level 1: quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 2: observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. level 3: unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data..

during 2009 we continued to see a soft market, which began in 2007, in our retail brokerage product line. in 2007, we experienced a soft market in many business lines and in many geographic areas. in a 2018 2018soft market, 2019 2019 premium rates flatten or decrease, along with commission revenues, due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity. changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry, as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds. prices fell throughout 2007, with the greatest declines seen in large and middle-market accounts. prices continued to decline during 2008, although the rate of decline slowed toward the end of the year. in our reinsurance brokerage product line, pricing overall during 2009 was also down, although during a portion of the year it was flat to up slightly. additionally, beginning in late 2008 and continuing throughout 2009, we faced difficult conditions as a result of unprecedented disruptions in the global economy, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial markets. continued volatility and further deterioration in the credit markets have reduced our customers 2019 demand for our retail brokerage and reinsurance brokerage products, which have negatively hurt our operational results. in addition, overall capacity in the industry could decrease if a significant insurer either fails or withdraws from writing insurance coverages that we offer our clients. this failure could reduce our revenues and profitability, since we would no longer have access to certain lines and types of insurance. risk and insurance brokerage services generated approximately 83% (83%) of our consolidated total revenues in 2009. revenues are generated primarily through fees paid by clients, commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies, and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients. our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of the timing of our clients 2019 policy renewals, the net effect of new and lost business, the timing of services provided to our clients, and the income we earn on investments, which is heavily influenced by short-term interest rates. we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms, as well as with individual brokers, agents, and direct writers of insurance coverage. specifically, we address the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises, professional groups, insurance companies, governments, healthcare providers, and non-profit groups, among others; provide affinity products for professional liability, life, disability income, and personal lines for individuals, associations, and businesses; provide reinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance; provide investment banking products and services, including mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory services, capital raising, contingent capital financing, insurance-linked securitizations and derivative applications; provide managing underwriting to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients; provide actuarial, loss prevention, and administrative services to businesses and consumers; and manage captive insurance companies. in november 2008 we expanded our product offerings through the merger with benfield, a leading independent reinsurance intermediary. benfield products have been integrated with our existing reinsurance products in 2009. in february 2009, we completed the sale of the u.s. operations of cananwill, our premium finance business. in june and july of 2009, we entered into agreements with third parties with respect to our.

net revenues include $3.8 billion in 2017 and $739 million in 2016 related to the sale of rrps, mainly driven by japan. these net revenue amounts include excise taxes billed to customers. excluding excise taxes, net revenues for rrps were $3.6 billion in 2017 and $733 million in 2016. in some jurisdictions, including japan, we are not responsible for collecting excise taxes. in 2017, approximately $0.9 billion of our $3.6 billion in rrp net revenues, excluding excise taxes, were from iqos devices and accessories. excise taxes on products increased by $1.1 billion, due to: 2022 higher excise taxes resulting from changes in retail prices and tax rates ($4.6 billion), partially offset by 2022 favorable currency ($1.9 billion) and 2022 lower excise taxes resulting from volume/mix ($1.6 billion). our cost of sales; marketing, administration and research costs; and operating income were as follows: for the years ended december 31, variance.

cost of sales increased by $1.0 billion, due to: 2022 higher cost of sales resulting from volume/mix ($1.1 billion), partly offset by 2022 lower manufacturing costs ($36 million) and 2022 favorable currency ($30 million). marketing, administration and research costs increased by $320 million, due to: 2022 higher expenses ($570 million, largely reflecting increased investment behind reduced-risk products, predominately in the european union and asia), partly offset by 2022 favorable currency ($250 million). operating income increased by $688 million, due primarily to: 2022 price increases ($1.4 billion), partly offset by 2022 higher marketing, administration and research costs ($570 million) and 2022 unfavorable currency ($157 million). interest expense, net, of $914 million increased by $23 million, due primarily to unfavorably currency and higher average debt levels, partly offset by higher interest income. our effective tax rate increased by 12.8 percentage points to 40.7% (40.7%). the 2017 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by $1.6 billion due to the tax cuts and jobs act. for further details, see item 8, note 11. income taxes to our consolidated financial statements. we are continuing to evaluate the impact that the tax cuts and jobs act will have on our tax liability. based upon our current interpretation of the tax cuts and jobs act, we estimate that our 2018 effective tax rate will be approximately 28% (28%), subject to future regulatory developments and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction. we are regularly examined by tax authorities around the world, and we are currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions. it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close, which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits along with related interest and penalties. an estimate of any possible change cannot be made at this time. net earnings attributable to pmi of $6.0 billion decreased by $932 million (13.4% (13.4%)). this decrease was due primarily to a higher effective tax rate as discussed above, partly offset by higher operating income. diluted and basic eps of $3.88 decreased by 13.4% (13.4%). excluding.

we back-test the estimated one-day var on a daily basis. this information is reviewed and used to confirm that all relevant trading positions are properly modeled. for the years ended december 31, 2008 and 2007, we did not experience any actual trading losses in excess of our end-of-day var estimate. asset and liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue, or nir, under varying economic environments, while protecting the economic values of our balance sheet assets and liabilities from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. most of our nir is earned from the investment of deposits generated by our core investment servicing and investment management businesses. we structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, but we manage our overall interest-rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally-approved risk guidelines. our overall interest-rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the board and guidelines established and monitored by alco. our global treasury group has responsibility for managing state street 2019s day-to-day interest-rate risk. to effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related nir, global treasury has the authority to take a limited amount of interest-rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short-term and long-term time horizons. global treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis organized into three regional treasury units, north america, europe and asia/pacific, to reflect the growing, global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position. our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest-rate risk. we invest in financial instruments with currency, repricing, and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest-rate risk position. in addition to on-balance sheet assets, we use certain derivatives, primarily interest-rate swaps, to alter the interest-rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities. the use of derivatives is subject to alco-approved guidelines. additional information about our use of derivatives is in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k under item 8. as a result of growth in our non-u.s. operations, non-u.s. dollar denominated customer liabilities are a significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet. this growth results in exposure to changes in the shape and level of non-u.s. dollar yield curves, which we include in our consolidated interest-rate risk management process. because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our exposures to changes in interest rates, we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on net interest revenue and balance sheet values. net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible net interest revenue results that could occur under a variety of interest-rate environments. we also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates. finally, gap analysis 2014the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities re-pricing within a specified time period 2014is used as a measurement of our interest-rate risk position..

the following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums and the impact of prior period development on our consolidated loss and loss expense ratio for the periods indicated..

loss and loss expense ratio adjusted | 60.3% (60.3%) | 61.7% (61.7%) | 62.7% (62.7%)

we recorded net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $366 million in 2010 compared with net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $137 million and $567 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. the catastrophe losses for 2010 were primarily related to weather- related events in the u.s., earthquakes in chile, mexico, and new zealand, and storms in australia and europe. the catastrophe losses for 2009 were primarily related to an earthquake in asia, floods in europe, several weather-related events in the u.s., and a european windstorm. for 2008, the catastrophe losses were primarily related to hurricanes gustav and ike. prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from pre- vious accident years. we experienced $503 million of net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments in 2010. this compares with net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments of $576 million and $814 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. refer to 201cprior period development 201d for more information. the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio declined in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements, non-recurring premium adjustment and the reduction in assumed loss portfolio business, which is written at higher loss ratios than other types of business. our policy acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting, and other costs that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of premium. administrative expenses include all other operating costs. our policy acquis- ition cost ratio increased in 2010, compared with 2009. the increase was primarily related to the impact of crop settlements, which generated higher profit-share commissions and a lower adjustment to net premiums earned, as well as the impact of reinstatement premiums expensed in connection with catastrophe activity and changes in business mix. our administrative expense ratio increased in 2010, primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements, reinstatement premiums expensed, and increased costs in our international operations. although the crop settlements generate minimal administrative expenses, they resulted in lower adjustment to net premiums earned in 2010, compared with 2009. administrative expenses in 2010, were partially offset by higher net results generated by our third party claims administration business, esis, the results of which are included within our administrative expenses. esis generated $85 million in net results in 2010, compared with $26 million in 2009. the increase is primarily from non-recurring sources. our policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2009, compared with 2008, as increases in our combined insurance operations were offset by more favorable final crop year settlement of profit share commissions. administrative expenses increased in 2009, primarily due to the inclusion of administrative expenses related to combined insurance for the full year and costs associated with new product expansion in our domestic retail operation and in our personal lines business. our effective income tax rate, which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax, is depend- ent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates. a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate. our effective income tax rate was 15 percent in 2010, compared with 17 percent and 24 percent in 2009 and 2008, respectively. the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2010, was primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings to lower tax-paying jurisdictions, a decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which was the result of a settlement with the u.s. internal revenue service appeals division regarding federal tax returns for the years 2002-2004, and the recognition of a non-taxable gain related to the acquisition of rain and hail. the 2009 year included a reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to investments. for 2008, our effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by a change in mix of earnings due to the impact of catastrophe losses in lower tax-paying jurisdictions. prior period development the favorable prior period development, inclusive of the life segment, of $512 million during 2010 was the net result of sev- eral underlying favorable and adverse movements. with respect to ace 2019s crop business, ace regularly receives reports from its managing general agent (mga) relating to the previous crop year (s) in subsequent calendar quarters and this typically results.

the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $24.6 million and $23.6 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. these amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable in their respective years. we file income tax returns in the united states on a federal basis and in many u.s. state and foreign jurisdictions. we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. our major tax jurisdictions are ireland, california and the united states. for ireland, california and the united states, the earliest fiscal years open for examination are 2008, 2014 and 2015, respectively. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. we believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of short-term and long- term assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. we believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential effect in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $45 million..

in the table above: 2030 derivative assets are shown as positive amounts and derivative liabilities are shown as negative amounts. 2030 ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of derivative. 2030 averages represent the arithmetic average of the inputs and are not weighted by the relative fair value or notional of the respective financial instruments. an average greater than the median indicates that the majority of inputs are below the average. for example, the difference between the average and the median for credit spreads and oil spread inputs indicates that the majority of the inputs fall in the lower end of the range. 2030 the ranges, averages and medians of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one derivative. for example, the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest rate derivative. accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of the firm 2019s level 3 derivatives. 2030 interest rates, currencies and equities derivatives are valued using option pricing models, credit derivatives are valued using option pricing, correlation and discounted cash flow models, and commodities derivatives are valued using option pricing and discounted cash flow models. 2030 the fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. for example, option pricing models and discounted cash flows models are typically used together to determine fair value. therefore, the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques. 2030 correlation within currencies and equities includes cross- product type correlation. 2030 natural gas spread represents the spread per million british thermal units of natural gas. 2030 oil spread represents the spread per barrel of oil and refined products. range of significant unobservable inputs the following is information about the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm 2019s level 3 derivative instruments: 2030 correlation. ranges for correlation cover a variety of underliers both within one product type (e.g., equity index and equity single stock names) and across product types (e.g., correlation of an interest rate and a currency), as well as across regions. generally, cross-product type correlation inputs are used to value more complex instruments and are lower than correlation inputs on assets within the same derivative product type. 2030 volatility. ranges for volatility cover numerous underliers across a variety of markets, maturities and strike prices. for example, volatility of equity indices is generally lower than volatility of single stocks. 2030 credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates. the ranges for credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates cover a variety of underliers (index and single names), regions, sectors, maturities and credit qualities (high-yield and investment-grade). the broad range of this population gives rise to the width of the ranges of significant unobservable inputs. 130 goldman sachs 2017 form 10-k.
